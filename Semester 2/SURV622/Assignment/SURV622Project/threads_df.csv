De Gaulle was right about containing the US influence in Europe, that is why it took so long for GB to be accepted in the club, but just remember too that he hijacked the EEC with the empty chair crisis to force a deal on Agriculture policy in Frances favour and to block the Commissions proposal to start working with majority votes in the council rather than unanimity, setting us back decades of immobilism until the Single European Act! If other Member States acted so selfishly, there wouldnt be any Union today. 
The worst thing is that it placed a precedent: if you want something form the EU then make sure youre the crybaby in the room. A technique that was later successfully used by GB in the 80s, Germany during the 2010 Euro crisis and now Hungary.

"2025-02-26",1740564195,"What We Know About the U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal","A draft agreement discussed on Tuesday does not include a $500 billion payout the Trump administration demanded earlier.

Ukraine has agreed to a deal to turn over the revenue from some of its mineral resources to the United States, an American and a Ukrainian official said on Tuesday, after an intense pressure campaign from President Trump.

Terms of the agreement
The final details of the agreement, including the amount of money that Ukraine will pay the United States, are not yet known.

But a draft agreement discussed on Tuesday no longer included the demand that Ukraine contribute $500 billion to a fund owned by the United States. It also did not include a clause requiring Ukraine to pay back the United States twice the amount of any future American aid.
The Ukrainians became more comfortable with the deal in the past few days after the Americans removed some of the more onerous conditions.

The draft agreement said Ukraine would contribute to a fund half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources, including critical minerals, oil and gas. The United States would own the maximum financial interest in the fund allowed under American law, though not necessarily all. And the fund would be designed to reinvest some revenues into Ukraine.

Security guarantee
Mr. Zelensky had repeatedly pressed for security guarantees for his country in exchange for mineral rights, as Russias war has entered its fourth year. But draft agreements reviewed by The New York Times included no such security commitment.

Approval process
A final translated draft of the agreement was sent to Ukraine on Tuesday, according to the American official.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, the American official said, are expected to sign the agreement first and then Mr. Zelensky is expected to go to Washington for a signing with Mr. Trump.

Whats at stake
Ukraine controls more than 100 major deposits of critical minerals, according to a study by the Kyiv School of Economics, along with modest oil and natural gas reserves.

Titanium is used in construction, airplanes, orthopedic implants and as an additive in paint and cosmetics, including sunscreen, among many other things. Titanium mines in central Ukraine account for about 6 percent of global production, according to Ukrainian media.

Lithium is a crucial element in batteries, including those in electric vehicles, and in other industrial products, including some medications. Ukraine has a third of Europes total reserves, although some sites are in war-contested areas. Before the war with Russia, Ukrainian officials suggested to Elon Musk that he invest in Ukrainian lithium mines.
Uranium is used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Ukraine has the largest uranium reserves in Europe.

Rare earths are a group of more than a dozen metals, much less abundant than titanium or lithium, that are used in many high-tech sectors, including green energy, electronics and aerospace. Ukraine has substantial reserves that are mostly untapped, and it is unclear how expensive they would be to extract.

The differences emerged after a showpiece London summit in which Europes biggest powers sought to project unity and develop a common plan following a disastrous White House meeting between presidents Donald Trump of the US and Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine.

Macron said after Sundays summit that his idea for a limited, one-month ceasefire in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure would have the advantage of verifying Russias intentions. The French president has a record of floating policy ideas to push allies towards agreement.

The UK, which hosted the summit, said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wanted to move forward with the peace plan with momentum. But Starmers allies said the one-month truce was not a UK plan.

A British official said: There are various options on the table, subject to further discussions with the US and European partners, but a one-month truce has not been agreed.

UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard warned on Monday against a pause in the fighting in Ukraine that could enable Russia to regroup.

He told Sky News: The very real worry that the Ukrainians have is that any short pause in the war simply allows the Russians time to re-arm, regroup and reinvade.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed misgivings about some of the Franco-British ideas.

The only thing that we really cannot afford is a peace that does not last, Meloni told reporters on Sunday. This is something that Ukraine cannot afford, Europe cannot afford, and the United States cannot afford.

Zelenskyy has also rejected calls for Ukraine to agree an immediate ceasefire in its war with Russia. As he departed the UK from the summit, he said it would be failure for everyone if a cessation of hostilities were not accompanied by detailed security guarantees.

He declined to comment on Macrons proposal.

The French president told Le Figaro on Sunday that a one-month truce in the air and sea would be easier than overseeing a truce on the ground along the entire front line. In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify that the front is being respected, he said.

We can measure it, he said. You have to understand that the front today is equivalent to the Paris-Budapest line. In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify that the front is being respected.

The French and British leaders are hoping a deal would involve US cover for troops from a European coalition of the willing deployed to secure any ceasefire in Ukraine.

Starmer said after the summit that while Europe must do the heavy lifting, the effort must have strong US backing. The European plan would also see Zelenskyy sign a deal with the US to share some of the profits from exploiting Ukraines mineral reserves.

That agreement had been intended to be concluded on Friday, but was left unsigned after Trump ejected Zelenskyy from the White House following their dispute in the Oval Office.

Lord Peter Mandelson, UK ambassador to Washington, urged Zelenskyy to sign the minerals deal and called on Ukraine and European leaders to give unequivocal backing to the initiative President Trump is taking to broker a peace.

In comments that Pollard, the UK armed forces minister, said were not government policy, Mandelson told ABC: Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow.

Zelenskyy said he saw no need to make amends following the White House confrontation or come up with a plan to salvage his relationship with Trump, although he restated his gratitude to the American people.

If you dont have an end to the war and you dont have security guarantees, no one is able to control a ceasefire, the Ukrainian president said from Londons Stansted airport as he prepared to fly back to Kyiv.","europe",58,"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j2fyo4/uk_distances_itself_from_macrons_ukraine/"

"2025-02-27",1740643928,"Indifference or Hostility? Trump's view of European Alles raises Alarm","** Debate is building over just how deep the Trump administrations antagonism runs, and whether the real goal is to destroy the European Union.**

During his first term in office, President Trump described the European Union as a foe, established to hurt the United States on trade.

He repeated the charge at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, but in more vulgar terms: The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. Thats the purpose of it, and theyve done a good job of it.

Then he said he was preparing to hit Europe with 25 percent tariffs on cars and other goods.

After Mr. Trumps embrace of Russia and his warnings that Europe had better fend for itself, the presidents latest attack added to the increasing view of European leaders and analysts that he and his team of loyalists consider Americas traditional allies in Europe as adversaries not just on trade, but on nearly everything.

Some officials and analysts see the Trump administration as merely indifferent to Europe; others see open hostility. But there is a common view that the fundamental relationship has changed and that America is a less reliable and predictable ally.
Mr. Trump has rebuffed NATO and aligned himself with the longstanding, principal threat to the alliance: Russia. Vice President JD Vance has attacked European democracy while calling for the door to be opened to far-right parties. Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump aide, has heaped contempt on European leaders and openly endorsed an extremist party in Germany.

Equally shocking to European leaders, the United States this week refused to condemn Russias invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations. It instead broke from its allies and voted with Russia, Belarus and North Korea, all authoritarian governments.

European leaders are scrambling to assess and mitigate the damage. The prime minister of Britain, Keir Starmer, arrives at the White House on Thursday  the second such visit this week, after President Emmanuel Macron of France  still hoping to persuade Mr. Trump not to abandon Ukraine and to remain engaged in Europe. But Mr. Trump describes himself as a disrupter, and Mr. Macron got little for his attempt at seduction.
Friedrich Merz, 69, the conservative politician likely to be Germanys next chancellor, has expressed strong doubts about the trans-Atlantic relationship he and his country have been committed to for decades.

On Sunday evening, after his party won the most votes in the German election, Mr. Merz said that after listening to Mr. Trump, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.

He wondered whether the American nuclear umbrella over NATO would remain  and even whether the alliance itself would continue to exist.

My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA, he said.
His comments were a remarkable measure of the dismay felt by European leaders over the American reversal of policy on Ukraine and, perhaps more so, for its outright backing of far-right parties that despise European governments and support Russia.

Mr. Merzs remarks were reminiscent of a 2017 statement by Angela Merkel, then the German chancellor, after contentious alliance meetings with Mr. Trump. The times in which we could rely fully on others  they are somewhat over, she said. She encouraged Europeans to take our fate into our own hands.

Her comments were considered a potentially seismic shift, but a real reorientation of European security policy never materialized. Matters are more serious now, said Claudia Major, who directs security policy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
In Munich, Vance declared a culture war and said: Join us or not. We have the right values and you have it wrong, she said. His speech, she added, made it clear that the country that brought us back our freedom and our democracy is turning against us.

She is not alone in the assessment. Several analysts said the Trump administrations actions showed that it was not merely indifferent to Europe, but was out to undo it. The distinction holds real consequences for how Europe can respond.

There is no question the intention is there to destroy Europe, starting with Ukraine, said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italys Institute of International Affairs. The empowering of the far right is instrumental to the goal of destroying the European Union.
The reason, she said, is that the Trump administration sees Europe not merely as a competitor, but also as an economic and even ideological threat. It wants to undermine the power of the European Union to regulate trade, competition and hate speech. The latter is a major topic for Mr. Vance, as he criticized what he called news media censorship and political correctness.

The European Union is the largest trading bloc in the world, capable of striking back against Washington economically and in tariff terms, representing the economic foe Mr. Trump railed against in his first term.

That power is being used against high-tech and social media companies whose leaders surround and subsidize Mr. Trump, like Mr. Musk, who owns the social media platform X. They, too, have an interest in weakening the Brussels Effect, as Anu Bradford of Columbia University Law School called it.

The Brussels Effect is the power of the European Union to establish global rules and norms, and it is particularly important in the realms of climate regulations, digital competition, platform accountability and artificial intelligence.

But if the Trump administration feels it necessary to destroy that threat, then there is little European nations can do to appease the White House, some warned.

If Mr. Trump and his team are out to push the far right and destroy European democracy, then no amount of European purchasing of American LNG or weapons will matter, said Ms. Tocci, of Italys Institute of International Affairs. By increasing dependency, she added, it could be a kind of double suicide.

U.S.-European relations tend to go in cycles, with important strategic debates in the past over Iraq or Afghanistan or even Vietnam. But now the clashes are simultaneously ideological, strategic and economic, said Camille Grand, a former NATO and French official with the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Facing hostility on all three fronts at once is quite a shock to Europeans, said Mr. Grand. Adding all three together you can wonder whether you are no longer a partner but a rival and, perhaps, even an adversary.

Every country in Europe is doing a reassessment of where it is vis-à-vis Washington, he said. What isnt clear is whether, as in Mr. Trumps first term, you have an unpleasant roller-coaster ride that leaves you sick but you end up where you started, or whether the whole relationship now derails.

Linas Kojala, director of the Geopolitics and Security Studies Center in Vilnius, Lithuania, urges calm, because there is no real alternative to the U.S. security guarantee for a long time to come. Declaring the trans-Atlantic relationship has collapsed would be like stepping off a ship in the middle of the ocean with no other vessel in sight.

So for now, he said, Europe must swallow the Trump criticism and do everything possible to keep the relationship intact.

But it is unlikely to return to where it was, Alex Younger, a former chief of Britains foreign intelligence service, MI6, told the BBC last week. We are in a new era where, by and large, international relations arent going to be determined by rules and multilateral institutions, he said, but by strongmen and deals.

Matthew Kroenig, a former defense department official who is now at the Atlantic Council in Washington, calls himself a normal Republican and says that there has been a bit too much hysteria over the past couple of weeks.

After all, Mr. Kroenig said, the first Trump term was also marked by a lot of tough rhetoric against allies and a lot of deferential language toward Putin, but in the end, NATO was strengthened.

Others are less sure.

Mr. Trump has been engaged in a policy of rapid, unilateral concession of long-held positions on fundamental interests to persuade the aggressor to stop fighting, said Nigel Gould-Davies of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, speaking of Russia in Ukraine.

The established name for such a policy, he said, is strategic surrender.

Whether it will produce the outcome Mr. Trump desires is not clear, he said. What is clear is that it is undermining allied trust in the credibility and common sense of the United States.

It is imperiling old allies in Europe.

And it is making Russia a more powerful, assertive and attractive ally to Americas adversaries around the world, he said.

"2025-02-28",1740778450,"Whats happening in Greece?","A train with destination to Thessaloniki crashed with a freight train (the material in it is being classified by the government). Basically the station master accidentally put the passenger train to the opposite direction and both trains were on the same trail for 12 minutes. 
A mushroom like explosion occurred as they crashed, both train drivers died instantly and the first 3 wagons were in devastating condition. Most people from these wagons died instantly, while others were burned alive. There are 57 identified victims while people say there are up to 48 unidentified missing ones with many refugees who didnt have their papers so we were never able to verify. 
However, this wasnt just an accident. Thats why Greek people are so much more devastated and in need of answers. Based on The European Union , all trains must have a percentage of etcs which is an automatic system to protect trains from such incidents and leave NO room for human errors. Greece has 0% of this system. Against the law of the European Union. A year prior to the crash, 3 warrants were issued to the government to start the process of installing the ects system in Hellenic Train. Most were dismissed, while the third one resulted in one threatening message to them, blackmailing them that the will resort in a lawsuit for defamation. A few months later, on 28th of February 2023,at 23:21, the inevitable happened. 
Most victims were young adults as it was the day after a 3 day holiday here in Greece, so many students that studied outside of their hometowns were going back to their universities. 
Ironically, the minister of transportation had stated a few weeks ago that as of now the train was the SAFEST means of transportation here, knowing very well that there were no safety measures whatsoever. 
The government tries to cover it up and claims that it was just an accident of human error. They dont tell us the material that caused the fire, they dont want to admit that its their fault. People died, people are now handicapped, people are traumatised. Its also worth mentioning that Hellenic train was bought recently by a private company, there isnt enough staff and not proper care of the infrastructures. 
Today is the two year anniversary. Athens and whole Greece was paralysed. A strike happened and the parliament got vandalised. Cops started hitting people and spraying chemicals. It was supposed to be a peaceful protest but they didnt care. Cops attacked people that were protesting by SITTING DOWN. Today Greece was united by those 57 souls and all the other ones that were never found. This day will make history.

But economists are aware of policies that tend to be effective: spending on basic research and development, investing in education and training, and engaging with the global economy through immigration and cross-border investment. Such policies will not improve productivity overnight, and the United States will need separate measures to make sure everyone can enjoy a boomsuch as resources to support workers whose jobs might be destroyed by generative artificial intelligence. But if Washington recommits to this trifecta of tools, the United States will likely see faster productivity growth. It could then begin to solve many of the countrys most intractable problems""

How do we restore productivity growth to post world war two levels in USA. No, the answer is not to use intelligence operatives to foment a world war, that doesn't reach American shores. That might work, but at loss of human lives, and risk to the future of humanity. Instead consider investing in knowledge and people. Including basic research, quality of high school education, government funding of University education, welcoming talented immigrants, and participating in the globalized economy.

***Photo above*** *- Former Fox channel talk show host - and new FBI assistant director - Dan Bongino. This reporter reached out Director Dan for a comment on the billion-dollar crypto heist, but her call was not returned by press time.*

In a column last week I satirized the mainstream media for trying to foist off high egg prices as Trump's inflation. Thank you for your thoughtful replies, brickbats, and rants.

But heres one problem which I do think Trump deserves some credit for. North Korean hackers made off with $1.5 billion of someones cryptocurrency in the middle of the night. See link below.

The victim was Bybit, a slippery crypto company founded in Singapore, operating in Dubai, but registered in The British Virgin Islands (a tax haven). Bybits founder Ben Zhou was born in China, went to college in the US, returned to China to work at a Cypriot registered currency exchange company called XM. Mr. Zhou then became a YouTube apostle for cryptocurrency before founding Bybit. Mr. Zhou may currently be residing in New Zealand where he also holds citizenship, although internet sources are in disagreement on this.

Would it help if we put a map on the wall festooned with colored thumbtacks, like they do in ""True Detective"" shows?

What does Bybit do? It keeps your crypto currency safe in their wallet. Stop laughing, this is absolutely true. Bybit shares are down 50% over the past week (from $280 to $140). Solana, a similar wallet company (SOL-USD) has also lost half its value. But Solana was already having problems; it's the creator of those Trump and Melania meme-coins, and is implicated in last month's Argentina crypto fraud.

So other than Trump hawking a bunch of questionable meme coins, why should this ginormous North Korean hack be his problem?

Well, it IS the largest crypto hack in world history. And it was pulled off by a bunch of guys in some Pyongyang basement subsisting on Kimchi (fermented cabbage) and dog soup (yes, thats really a thing in North Korea). If THOSE guys can break into the crypto vaults, is anyone or anything safe?

Ive been saying  since the Biden administration  that crypto and investment dont belong in the same sentence. Crypto currency is imaginary, made of bits and bytes and electrons. It doesnt produce food, energy, or shelter. You cant buy any of those things with it either. However you CAN store it in a Bybit and Solana wallet and hope its still there on the day you want to convert it to real money. *""Remember to change your password regularly"".*

President Trump (and Musk) want us to think of crypto as real money. The North Koreans clearly do already. Trump got major campaign contributions (millions and millions) from crypto-friendly A-listers. He has floated plans to have an official US crypto currency. Which presumably will have to be stored in someones wallet. If the USA invents it's own official crypto wallet to store ""Eaglet meme coins"" Im not going to feel any safer. America already can't protect its electrical grid, water supplies, hospitals, and other vital infrastructure from hacking. Why would a US crypto wallet be any more secure?

The real problem isnt Bybit, Solana, or crypto of course. It's the constant hacks of our infrastructure, the pentagon, our satellites/GPS, banks . . . everything that we need to maintain the standard of living to which we have become accustomed. Electronic World War 3 is already underway. And if North Korea can attack us with impunity, we are sure to lose.

Over the past 4 years I continually urged the Biden administration to stop daydreaming about harvesting votes with student loan forgiveness and windmill subsidies. We have much bigger problems the government doesn't want to talk about. Mr. Trump, this is now your problem. If you want to create a new cabinet level czar for hacking protection, you have my endorsement. I doubt if Secretary of Defense Hegseth, or FBI assistant director Bongino are the right men for this problem.

Im just sayin . . .

Please be prepared to invest in the financial market","The argument between Trump, Vance, and Zelensky is refreshing to everyone. If we compare the Korean War, Vietnam War, and Russia Ukraine War from the perspective of data analysis, there are many similarities.

The United States spent 40 billion in the Korean War, 130 billion in the Vietnam War, and 350 billion in the Russo Ukrainian War. Converted by inflation, it is approximately between 350 billion and 400 billion;

2. It took about three years from the start of the battle to the exhaustion of fighting spirit and war weariness.

3. For agents, they have gone through a process from support to impatience and giving up. This is the process for Li Chengwan, Ruan Wenshao, and Zelensky.

If we look at it this way, the Russia Ukraine war is a great power game.

Therefore, a ceasefire is highly likely, and Ukraine will be within Russia's sphere of influence. Only the EU and Ukraine can hold on, they cannot sustain it.

But it won't stop immediately. We have to fight independently in Europe and Ukraine and suffer significant losses before peace can come (the evil fire won't be at ease until it's consumed). As usual, it is expected to be within six months. This event will trigger turbulence in the international financial market and is a good opportunity for investment.

Judging from Trump's recent covetousness of minerals in Greenland and Ukraine, it indicates that China's sanctions have caused significant damage and are seeking to break through.

And it coincided with 2008's crash except for this one lasted roughly twice as long 2008 lasted about a year and a half 2 years 2014 market was bearish for about 4 years now we're triple topping for the next bear season and yes there will be a bear season and it will be coming soon so I suggest you put your shorts and your puts in order and live yourself some leeway so the trades don't close out but Donald Trump is the only person with a business sense that can actually keep the shit from going fubar... I'm in imagine if you had this giant bear season coming up with Biden again and how it would annihilate America and other countries because we're all interconnected the way that they did things it worked only because it was at the end of the bull cycle had they been doing that s\*\*\* during this bear season coming up I can't even begin to tell you how I messed up stuff would be. So whether you love him or hate him and Donald Trump is a necessity and they put him there for a reason because he's the only one with the business since they can actually make decisions that will ease the market now 2008 dip down 2014 twice as long in that same trend this one could potentially last 4 years and even longer let that sink in and it's just because of the 2008 crash had that crash never happened or market would probably be way higher than it is now all markets would be but that crash like ripples and out pond you drove it to where it is now and I will forever have ripples with how the market structure is formed.

So all's I'm saying is is yes there will be a bear season but people are in order and their places to help ease that but I suggest you learn how to do short selling, put options and leverage the piss out of it but always understand leave yourself margin if you're leveraging higher amounts so if I'm doing a times 10 leverage in Forex, I do the leverage but would only trade about half of the account that way I have a nice amount of margin so it never stops me out and then I can add to it each week or whenever I get money to continuously ride this puppy all the way down because we all have the chance to make bukus and money and rest assured the government soon all the rich people see these charts and what they're doing and they see what bitcoins doing and they see how it's going to affect the market and I promise you they're going to be doing the same thing smart money will be putting sales and puts but I just want you to know how this coincides all with the 2008 market crash and now you have the bear season for crypto and you have the triple tops and all the bears sentiment in the Forex market it's all interconnected and once you understand that things will be far better. Not to say that a couple won't run because there's some newer currency pairs that are too new to be affected by the  crash and the subsequent four year bear season after that in 2014. I'm going to predict that from 2025 to about 2029 to 2030 and it's going to be bear season and that's okay cuz we can make money as it falls but get your blocks in early and don't be over leveraging the piss out of it at the beginning, what I would recommend is do like a x4 leverage, once you start seeing significant profits in the direction that we're ultimately going to be going then I would bump it up to 10x maybe a 25x, but keeping a ratioed amount in the account for margin to compensate for pull backs.

To the people who don't know what I'm talking about if you have a Forex account that's 500 times leverage and you say have $5,000 to use, if you use that entire $5,000 and you're in a trade or two you're leverage will literally margin you out immediately like almost instantaneously, that's what I'm saying if you're doing like a times 50 I would trade only like 40% of my account and leave the other 60% in there as margin, for the balance and equity to be nice and distributed leveraging is a very powerful tool and it is the key to getting rich.

But here we are my whole rant, it's funny how the elections lined up all because of the 2008 crash 2014 pull down and now everything's starting to top out and it's going to crash. And me personally one Bitcoin begins to see $45,000 and under I'm going to be scaling in all the time as much as I can if we can get it back down to 14k you remember when everyone was scared to get into the crypto market because it could go further, I'm not making that mistake again. Whenever Bitcoin goes below 20,000 I would highly suggest to be bullish. And it could even go down lower to 8k and the food will be crazy the comments will be riddled with people who are just saying cryptos the worst thing that was ever invented it's not going to do anything it's done but I promise you it will come back 14k was the last bear cycles low and it picked up and never stopped until now.

I will end it on this note the long-term bear cycle for all markets could be extremely long but Bitcoin is powerful enough to where if it is at Lowe's that you wouldn't think and all of a sudden it rallies it has the potential to run everything out of a bear market into a bull market so it may only last up until a bit starts to run again and then we break our triple top to the upside because of trump being in office and running it as a businessman that also helps. But if Bitcoin rallies and these others don't rally behind it it's going to be a real long bear season and I wouldn't even trust the first rally if everything else doesn't follow suit with bit it may rally up and then come back down because everything else is down and it's going to have to be because that's just how the crash made it the ripples in the chart it's all there and draw your trend lines look at the patterns so Bitcoin has the potential to end the bear market early but if it rallies and doesn't in the bear market then I would be careful scaling in with your life savings I would do a little bit at a time cuz if it rejects on its first rally it's going to fall pretty hard I can see it being honestly $7,000 a Bitcoin and most people ain't going to touch it but I promise you all your governments all your actual people that know what's happening will be buying the absolute s\*\*\* out of it just like I'm going to be. Did you imagine Bitcoin being $4,500 and ethereum be sitting at like $170...; and no one wanting to even get in on that, absolutely crazy ethereum will be over 10,000 on the next bull cycle, it could potentially do it this time but I think stuff's happening way too fast for it in all markets cuz everything is interconnected as I said now what do you think the price of Bitcoin is going to be once it comes down to its quote unquote all time lows and then rips up like it's done in the past two times. In the next motorcycle I could see Bitcoin easily achieving $275,000 to 550,000 a coin, remind you that's after it comes down for the bear cycle. I hope this age is like fine wine and not like milk and sorry if there's typos Google speech sometimes it's got a mind of its own.","economy",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1izmh24/why_donald_trump_is_the_president_and_the_future/"

***Photo above*** *- one of the 14,532 videogames released last year. You can immediately see the attraction this would have for a 30-year-old unemployed incel stoner . . .*  
  
House speaker Mike Johnson apparently has DOGEs back. Hes telling CNN that *Medicaid is for single mothers with small children who are just trying to make it. Not 20-something guys playing video games on the couch.* Yes . . . he really said that. See link below.  
  
Why werent we told this rip-off was happening before? Actually, I missed the warning signs myself.  
  
Next door neighbor to my mom has a 31-year-old (not 20 something) who hasnt worked in 4 years. The good news? He was turned down for welfare, because hes not disabled. The bad news? Hes collecting Medicaid. The worse news? Hes living off his moms social security check and savings. He drives a car provided (and insured) by her. He eats the food in her refrigerator. He pays no rent - he has no job. He doesnt even run the washing machine or dishwasher. Netflix and online videogaming are his chief pursuits.  
  
Actually, that Medicaid benefit might be helping him. Hes seeing both a psychologist AND a psychiatrist at the same time, paid for by Medicaid and the affordable Obamacare act. But this young man's caregivers disagree. The psychologist told him cut back on his drinking, but pot use was still A-OK. When he didnt get better, she referred him to the psychiatrist who told him to stop using ALL mind-altering substances and spend less time online. Maybe it takes a while for this sort of thing to build momentum, and show results? Anyway, the MLS season has started, and its must-see TV for this lad. Just in time too, because Premier League (British soccer) is winding down for the year. Televised Formula 1 races and hockey are also going to help fill his free time.  
  
If Medicaid is ended for people who refuse to get off the couch and get a job  like Mike Johnson threatens  my moms neighbor is going to face unimaginable choices. Actually DO get a job (he was formerly a clothing salesperson) . . . or lose his health coverage, and resume using pot and liquor. This is a fork in the road. Which path is likely to he choose? It hardly matters. His mom is going to pass in a few years, and he will inherit her house free and clear, and then lose it to repossession because he can't pay the property taxes and insurance. He and his mom are caught in a small-scale tragedy hidden from most people's view.  
  
There are no budget numbers attached to the CNN article. They would be highly speculative, anyway. We can probably count the number of single moms below the poverty line, who will keep their Medicaid benefits under Johnsons plan. But how you define able bodied and stoner and videogame addict could be controversial.  
  
The only thing I can be sure of  when Medicaid changes come  is that some legitimately sick kid is going to be front and center on the evening news. But thousands of slackers being cut off from free healthcare arent going to be the lead story.  
  
I hope no sick kids lose their benefits. But it's possible - in a perfect world - they might actually get BETTER healthcare if the government directs its sympathies and tax dollars to the truly needy, instead of truly pathetic couch potatoes.  
  
Im just sayin . . .

***Photo above*** *- AI (Stable Diffusion) rendering of yesterday's televised white house meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vance.*  
  
Wow . . . we are sooo going to save HUNDREDS of billions. US involvement in Ukraine is winding down. Putin is jubilant. Im okay with the US folding on a bad hand, but not Putin taking the pot. Is there a solution to all this?  
  
Everyone has probably seen the 3-way catfight between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vance by now. All 3 are idiots, so Im not going to assign blame. Hey guys, the effing camera is on. Thats what the blinking red light means. This is a thousand times worse than being caught on open mike, (See link below if you missed yesterdays episode of must-see TV).  
  
Theres no obvious way to de-escalate this unless someone holds a press conference and says they were wrong. And that wont be Trump or Vance. Why was Vance even there? He and Hegseth just screwed things up in Europe, problems which Secretary of State Rubio is still trying to fix. Vance brings negative energy wherever he goes. Hillbilly Hell-egy!  
  
Zelenskyy isnt going to cave either. He has no reason to. Hes in the midst of a tough re-election campaign, and the sentiment of Ukraine survivors and next of kin won't be to make it all meaningless in the end. Nobody wants to be the lapdog of the US President, whether it's Trump or Biden . . .  
  
So . . . we stop sending cash and tanks and jets to Ukraine. But maybe they DONT lose? Maybe the UK, France, Germany, and whoever else in NATO which has more than 3 operational aircraft . . . maybe THOSE nations do what they should have done back in 2022. Issue a declaration: *This is now a NATO operation. We have declared a no-fly zone over all of Ukraine. Any thing violating this airspace will be shot down. Any missiles and drones are fair game too, and we will bomb the airfields they were launched from. Have a nice day.*  
  
NATO was too chicken$hit to stand up when this thing started. They have to own it now. Whatever happens, it's on them. Enjoy your cheap Russian gas as long as the pipelines survive, guys.  
  
Yeah, this means calling Putins bluff. Nobody really believes hes going to nuke London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome. If he did, World War 3 would be on, like King Kong. The Russian generals are scared of Putin, but theyre don't want their families incinerated instantly in a counterstrike. Either the Ukraine ground war continues, with ambiguous results, or Putin falls out of a hotel window. Or his jet crashes. Or a bomb goes off under his limo. Or he falls ill after eating raw clams. Anything along those lines is feasible.  
  
Europe is waaaay behind on its NATO dues. The US has been covering their asses for decades. This is the part Trump actually gets right. Ukraine is a European problem. Get busy and fix it, you preening smart alecks. Stop bragging about your free healthcare, and start defending yourselves.  
  
Im just sayin . . .

If a millionaires wealth dropped below $500 million, they could keep earning until they reached the limit again, but never go over it. No one needs billions of dollars, and people have become numb to just how much money that is. This could help the economy and make things fairer for everyone.

Limiting extreme wealth could help redistribute money into communities which might improve public services, reduce poverty, and help prices go down. 
If this policy led to better wages, more social programs, and less wealth hoarding, it could increase overall financial stability. This could put a downward pressure on prices. but of course without direct action like rent controls, fair pricing regulations, or increased housing supply, the prices might not drop that much on their own. Just something to think about.

The Chinese conglomerate has increased the yield  the percentage of functional chips made on its production line  of its latest AI chips to close to 40 per cent, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That represents a doubling from 20 per cent about a year ago.

The move represents an important advance for Huawei, which has been rolling out its latest Ascend 910C processors, which offer better performance than its previous 910B product.""

According to the article in Financial Times, Ascend  chips production have become profitable, and Huawei is planning to improve yields to 60%. But Nvidia remains the market leader in China for AI chips. 

I believe Huawei will keep increasing production, with improving yields and capacity, and will overtake Nvidia in domestic sales. The domestic Chinese market for Nvidia is limited by US export controls. It will be more difficult for Huawei to compete with Nvidia internationally, especially in markets, where Nvidia is allowed to sell its highest performance chips.

"2025-03-01",1740850475,"29. Weekly Market Recap: Key Movements &amp; Insights","The S&amp;P 500 retreated this week as technology stocks faced significant pressure and new tariff announcements rattled investor confidence. After extending last week's sell-off, the index recovered some ground on Friday, though not enough to erase earlier losses. Nvidia, which has been the market's leading technology stock, dropped over 8% despite beating earnings expectations on Wednesday, signaling potential exhaustion in the AI trade that has dominated market sentiment for months. Rising jobless claims and disappointing consumer confidence data further dampened investor enthusiasm, while the White House's new tariff developments added another layer of uncertainty to an already fragile market environment.

Sector performance showed a clear rotation away from technology, with consumer non-durables, health technology, and communications emerging as relative safe havens. Meanwhile, consumer durables, technology services, and electronic technology lagged significantly. In the commodities space, gold's impressive streak ended, posting its first negative week after eight consecutive weeks of gains. Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market mirrored equities with a sharp decline before Friday's partial recovery, while oil prices edged lower amid global political uncertainties.

**Market Impact Analysis: Tariff Developments and Tech Weakness**

Recent market volatility is caused by two factors: weakness in technology stocks and new tariffs from the White House. The tech sector, previously a key market driver, shows signs of exhaustion as investors question the sustainability of AI-related growth. Tariff developments raise concerns about inflation and global supply chain disruptions.

Markets are vulnerable after recently reaching all-time highs. They face high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Sectors sensitive to trade tensions, like manufacturing and consumer technology, may experience ongoing pressure.

Next week could see a technical bounce as oversold conditions attract bargain hunters. However, the crucial issue is what follows the bounce. Investors should discern between a genuine recovery and a ""dead cat bounce"" before a deeper correction. If stabilizing above key technical levels with improving breadth and volume occurs, an uptrend may resume; if the bounce lacks conviction with declining volume and narrow participation, further downside is likely.

Thus, operations should focus on short-term strategies for now. Investors should maintain smaller positions and tighter stop-losses until market direction clarifies. Long-term investors should target resilient sectors such as Financials, Healthcare, and Consumer Defensive stocks that have gained over 5% year-to-date for better downside protection.

"2025-02-28",1740727780,"Do you expect that South Korea and Canada will abandon or even disown the United States completely and form an alliance with China very soon?","It was recently reported that China is planning to lift bans on Korean TV series, films, K-Pops, and so on by May:

&gt; **China Likely To Remove Ban On Korean Dramas, Movies &amp; K-Pop As Early As May**
&gt; 
&gt; Weve heard this before, and nothing came to pass, but the signs are looking positive that mainland China is finally removing its unofficial ban on Korean culture and content, possibly as early as this May.
&gt; 
&gt; The loosening of restrictions appears to signal Chinas shift away from a wolf warrior diplomatic policy towards a smile policy aimed at easing anti-China sentiments around the world. The move could also be interpreted as a response to the volatility of the current Donald Trump administration, which is threatening tariffs on many nations, although the U.S. Presidents approach towards China has not yet been made clear.
&gt; 
&gt; China started to restrict the distribution of Korean music, movies, dramas, games and all other forms of pop culture in 2016 in retaliation to South Koreas deployment of U.S. THAAD missile defense systems. Although Beijing has never officially acknowledged the ban, very few Korean movies or dramas have been released in Chinese cinemas or on streaming platforms and K-pop artists have not been allowed to perform in the country.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Korea Economic Daily (KED), a senior official handling Chinas preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, set to take place in China in 2026, said the Chinese government sees the need to strengthen cooperation with Korea:
&gt; 
&gt; Starting next month, we will send a private-level cultural delegation to South Korea as the first step toward expanding cultural exchanges, aiming to fully resume cultural cooperation as early as May, the official told KED.
&gt; 
&gt; It may also signal Chinas need to shore up its box office market. Despite the current success of record-breaking animation Nezha 2, the countrys box office was down by a punishing 23% last year, with a lack of product cited as one of the major reasons. Although China is not currently placing restrictions on Hollywood movies, the 2023 strikes resulted in a reduced pipeline of tentpole releases, which has had an adverse impact on Chinas box office, despite the popularity of local films.
&gt; 
&gt; Koreas entertainment market has also suffered as a result of the ban  the KDB Future Strategy Research Institute recently estimated that it caused damages of up to $15.3BN (KRW22TR) to related Korean industries in 2017, according to the KED report.
&gt; 
&gt; Shares of K-pop companies Hybe, JYP Entertainment and SM Entertainment have surged to new yearly highs in response to the news. Hybes share price is currently trading at an annual high of KRW254,000. Korean drama producers A Story (Extraordinary Attorney Woo) and CJ ENMs Studio Dragon also saw a bump in their share price on the news.
&gt; 
&gt; Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Hos Mickey 17, which recently had its world premiere at the Berlin film festival, is scheduled for China release on March 7, but then the film is a Warner Bros production and China has not previously restricted U.S. content due to the involvement of Korean nationals.

...and these are how one poster interpreted this situation:

&gt; With the US going Chaotic evil, China is reaching out and being the lawful evil partner. Not ideal but at least they're predictable in their self interest. Taking the soft power the US is throwing away.

https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1ixnuph/china_likely_to_remove_ban_on_korean_dramas/meo7qp9/

&gt; Have you considered why they were pro US? It's not simply by default. The US was a military ally of the regime in the South. Through trade and shared enemies it brought them into alignment. Access to the US market, US military gear, and defense pacts to keep North Korea at bay.
&gt; 
&gt; What is happening now is that the US president is widely anti trade, reneging on long standing military alliances, reneging on many treaties and pacts signed, threatening allies over petty nonsense. and growing closer to North Korea and Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; In the grand view China could court south Korea, Taiwan, and Japan by taking less of a hard-line and gain 3 high tech industrial nations and 80% of high end chip fabs. All they have to do is be less noxious and unreliable than the US president.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of lowering their SK ban is to warm up SK relations. They even sent positive signs to Canada to warm up those relations as the US threatens invasion. It is very political. China is picking up the influence the US is throwing away.

These are also his/her other arguments in other subreddits:

&gt; His goal isn't making a better stronger America, he's looting the US government and was placed there to destroy American power. The tarrif threats are things to create distance between American allies, he's also slashing their military spending, leaking the names of operatives like he did last time, dismantling their global influence, and destroying the rule of law in the US. His goal is to loot but to get here he is doing things for Russia in exchange for the opportunity to be the American dictator. The other far right groups want more control work beside him. The racists, the religious freaks, and the existing fascists.
&gt; 
&gt; Some part of it is threats to try to elicit personal bribes. Some part of it is Russia's global agenda. Some part of it is a insidious native racist fascist movement which is close to being just the confederacy.

https://old.reddit.com/r/onguardforthee/comments/1iv50jc/trump_says_he_will_impose_retaliatory_tariffs_for/me3srdk/?context=3

&gt; It's as flimsy as provinces using the not withstanding clause and the feds not pushing the issue. All our rights are at stake with bad faith actors like the UCP and CPC possibly being in charge. They push on the edges of our system to try to break it in their favor.
&gt; 
&gt; We can't elect people like Pierre Poilievre who don't respect truth or due process, his sloganeering and mentor links him to the global cabal of tyrant right wingers who break their systems with the cooperation of cronies and other authoritarians.
&gt; 
&gt; The ultimate goal is to loot and make us weak, so that adversaries like Russia and trump can walk in and conquer. Because the right wing ideology is all focused on strong talk but actions that weaken and break things.
&gt; 
&gt; Every country that elects the right wing parties aligned with Harper's IDU starts being dictatorial and weakens itself by cutting off allies and ceding power to Russia.

***Photo above*** *- Happier days. Back when reporters actually showed up for a Gavin Newsom press conference. Now he has pivoted to podcasts to get his message out.*  
  
Okay, Gavin Newsom did NOT say that (profits will go to help the homeless). But the sitting governor/2028 presidential candidate did announce he is launching a podcast . . . *This is Gavin Newsom.*  
  
Governor Newsom promised that his show will not be *the typical politician podcast.* He promises to invite people he disagrees with. Which is actually what happens in almost every podcast already in existence. Gavin . . . do you actually know how this works? The governor's first podcast topic is apparently: *Whats going on with the price of eggs?* Seriously. See the link below.  
  
Im not sure how Governor Newsom is going to find a podcast foil who disagrees that egg prices have skyrocketed. He MIGHT find someone ignorant of bird flu or fronting an anti-vax agenda. Is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. available?  
  
I dont want to cast too much shade on This is Gavin Newsom. As a self serving stunt its not as deplorable as a meme-coin. And podcasts are what a politician would naturally pivot to after reporters stop showing up at press conferences. Apparently, laws prevent elected officials from hosting a half hour daily spot on CNN or Fox.  
  
Newsoms podcast will be distributed by iHeart media, formerly Clear Channel communications. A giant media conglomerate which owns more US radio stations than any other company. Now iHeart has jumped into Podcasts with both feet. Governor Newsom will join other A-list podcasters such as David Axelrod, Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck, Dan Bongino, James Carville, Ted Cruz, Al Franken, Newt Gingrich, Trey Gowdy, Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, Bill Maher, Bill OReilly . . . (I can keep going if you want. There are dozens more trying to occupy the politics-podcast space).  
  
If the list above proves anything, its that reading has gone out of style. You can listen to this dreck on your air buds at the gym, while commuting to work, or pretending to work. Nobody has time to read, and literacy is a fundamental challenge for so many people to begin with.  
  
So far Obama, Biden and Kamala DON'T have their own podcasts. Biden, I can understand with his cognitive decline. In his last press conference, he was all I told you so. Only I could have beaten Trump on election day. Sheesh!  
  
The Obamas inked a $65 million deal with Netflix, so any podcast would be a distraction, not an income producing asset. That leaves Kamala. Her agent is probably on the phone to iHeart right this minute. If Gavin  who is a 2028 candidate for the presidential nomination  can have his own podcast, then Kamala will want one too. iHeart should give her one, just to be fair, balanced, and DEI. Gavin is a millionaire white male. Kamala is clueless. They can host each other on their respective podcasts, and debate egg prices.  
  
Does anybody know how much Governor Newsom is being paid for his podcast deal? Or what any of these other thought leaders (propagandists) earn from their podcasts? Im especially interested in other white male weirdos like Dan Bongino and Al Franken.  
  
Im just sayin . . .

# Company Overview: Who is ASML and What Do They Do?

ASML Holding N.V. is one of the most vital yet least-known companies outside the world of investors. Founded in 1984 in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML has become an indispensable force in the semiconductor industry, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital technology.

At the heart of ASMLs significance lies lithographya process essential for manufacturing microchips. Think of it as an ultra-precise printing technique, where complex circuit patterns are projected onto silicon wafers. These circuits are so minuscule that theyre measured in nanometerstens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. ASMLs lithography machines use advanced light-based technology to etch these patterns with astonishing accuracy.

What truly sets ASML apart is its mastery of **Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography**, a breakthrough technology that took decades and billions of euros to develop. EUV enables the production of semiconductor chips with features as small as **3 nanometers**, a scale that was once thought impossible. To put that into perspective, its akin to drawing a flawless circle **14,000 times smaller than a human hair**.

Replicating ASMLs success is virtually impossible. Each EUV machine is an engineering marvel, consisting of over **100,000 precision-engineered components**, requiring **40 shipping containers** for transport, and needing **four Boeing 747s** just to be delivered. The machines are assembled through a vast network of **more than 700 specialized suppliers**, a finely tuned ecosystem that took decades to build.

With its unrivaled expertise, ASML effectively holds the keys to the future of semiconductor manufacturing, making it one of the most critical yet underappreciated companies in the global technology landscape.

During the 1960s, the federal government paid for about two-thirds of all US R&amp;D compared with 30 per cent by the private sector. More recently, the federal government has accounted for only 20 per cent of total R&amp;D spending compared with 70 per cent by the private sector.""

The end of big government, and scientific funding for basic research, is here. Let us hope that the vision of a neoliberal utopia is realized. The past peak in science spending was driven by the cold war: economic, military, and technological competition with Russia. Russia has been broken up. China is now the economic, military, and technological competition for USA. As China ramps up spending on science and technology, USA risks being left behind.

But hey, we are all capitalists here. Markets forces will determine the type of allocation and funding for R&amp;D. Who cares for basic research. It is a public good, which doesn't deliver predictable sales and profits: it's not going to impact economy and markets within the next few years.

Based on my knowledge, health care, is a very secure and well paid, profession, especially in USA. And in India, they are mostly concerned with making money too, based on personal experience. For example they illegally detain you in hospitals, to give you unnecessary treatment, and don't let you leave unless you pay your accumulated bills. Teachers in India, have high abscency rates, especially in rural areas. Non-profits, are run like businesses: where they are infiltrated by the authorities, and care more about dress codes, than the quality of your work.

I have no experience with sustainability managers, but will not be suprised to find, that the few idealists are turned into short term profits capitalists. Business is about making money. ESG and stakeholder capitalism are only valued, as far as their financial impact. Sustainability should be part of corporate strategy, but probably in most companies, it is only about compliance.

Introduction
The American manufacturing landscape, once a tapestry of small factories, family-run shops, and regional innovators, has been reshaped by the relentless pricing power of multinational corporations (MNCs). This powerrooted in economies of scale, global outsourcing, and market consolidationhas hollowed out domestic industry, eroded consumer bargaining leverage, and left small businesses struggling to survive.

From the decline of mom-and-pop retailers to the rise of Amazons data-driven dominance, from the Chicken Taxs distortion of the auto industry to the CHIPS Acts glimmer of hope, and now Trumps looming tariffs, the story of U.S. manufacturing is one of missed opportunities and structural missteps. We argue that reversing this hollowing requires not blunt protectionism but targeted incentivesrepealing the Chicken Tax, empowering states with federal support, and boosting strategic sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs)to rebuild a competitive, innovative industrial base.

Background: The Roots of Pricing Power

Pricing powerthe ability to set prices without losing market shareemerged as a defining feature of American corporations as industrialization scaled up in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Early retail giants like Sears leveraged mail-order catalogs and bulk purchasing to undercut local merchants, while manufacturers like Ford pioneered assembly lines to slash costs. By the mid-20th century, economies of scale gave large firms an edge: they could spread fixed costs over vast output, negotiate better supplier deals, and invest in distribution networks small players couldnt match.

Post-World War II, globalization turbocharged this advantage. The Bretton Woods system and later trade liberalization opened markets, letting U.S. firms outsource labor to low-wage regionsAsias rise as a manufacturing hub began with Japan in the 1960s, then shifted to China by the 1990s. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked at 19.5 million in 1979 (BLS), but as firms chased cheaper labor, it slid to 12.9 million by 2023a 34% drop. Meanwhile, corporate profits soared: S&amp;P 500 firms net margins hit 12.8% in 2023, up from 7% in 1980 (FactSet). This wasnt just efficiencyit was power consolidation, leaving small manufacturers and retailers in the dust.

The Shift: From Mom-and-Pop to Amazon
The erosion of small businesses traces a clear arc from local retail to corporate behemoths. In the 1950s, a hardware store or grocer could thrive on community ties and modest scale. Owners haggled with suppliers, set prices based on local demand, and faced competition they could see across town. Consumer bargaining power held firmwalk away, and another shop beckoned.
Enter the chains. By the 1970s, firms like Walmart scaled up, buying in bulk and slashing prices. A 2021 Institute for Local Self-Reliance study found that for every two jobs Walmart created, three local jobs vanished as small retailers folded. The U.S. Census Bureau charts the decline: small firms share of retail sales fell from 15% in 1997 to 11% by 2019, while the top 100 firms share rose from 30% to over 40%. Pricing power shiftedWalmart could dictate terms to suppliers, forcing razor-thin margins that small competitors couldnt endure.

Amazon took this to a new level. Launched in 1994, it weaponized the internets reach and data analytics. By 2025, Amazons U.S. retail market share hit 38% (eMarketer), dwarfing Walmarts 7%. Its pricing power stems from scale (1.5 million packages daily), logistics (Primes free shipping), and datatracking every click to optimize prices or launch house brands like AmazonBasics. These knockoffs, mimicking top sellers products, squeeze small vendors who rely on Amazons platform but face rising fees (15-40% per sale) and algorithm tweaks favoring Amazons own goods. A 2020 Wall Street Journal investigation revealed Amazon used third-party sales data to copy successful items, undercutting innovators with cheaper alternatives.

This hollowing isnt just retailits manufacturing. Small factories supplying local marketsthink toolmakers or textile millscant match MNCs outsourced costs. U.S. textile jobs dropped from 900,000 in 1990 to 100,000 by 2023 (BLS), as firms like Nike shifted to Vietnam. The result: fewer domestic players, less competition, and MNCs free to raise markups67% over cost by 2014, up from 18% in 1980 (De Loecker et al., 2021). Consumers, with fewer options, face stubborn inflationcore PCE rose 2.9% in 2024, with underlying pressures hinting at more (ITR Economics).

The Chicken Tax: A Case Study in Distortion
The Chicken Taxa 25% tariff on light trucks since 1964illustrates how pricing power, propped up by protectionism, can backfire on manufacturing innovation. Born from a U.S.-Europe trade spat over poultry, it aimed to shield Detroit from foreign pickups. It worked short-term: VWs Type 2 vans faded, and Ford, GM, and Chrysler locked down the truck market. By 2023, light trucks (pickups, SUVs, crossovers) were 80% of U.S. auto sales, up from 50% in 1990 (WardsAuto).
But the tariff warped the industry. With imports taxed out, Detroit pivoted to high-margin trucksFords F-150 nets $42 billion yearly, with 20% margins vs. 5% on sedans (UBS 2022). Loopholes emerged: Toyota imported cab-chassis trucks at 4% duty, adding beds stateside; Fords Transit Connect vans dodged the tax as passenger vehicles with removable seats. This encouraged heavier designsF-150s tip 5,000+ lbswhile CAFE standards (27.5 mpg for trucks vs. 54.5 for cars by 2025) let gas-guzzlers thrive.

The real cost was innovation. Protected from competition, Ford and GM coasted on ICE trucks, delaying EVs. Their F-150 Lightning ($55,000) and Hummer EV ($112,000) arrived late and pricey, trailing Teslas $39,000 Model 3 (post-$7,500 credit). R&amp;D laggedFords $11 billion EV spend since 2018 pales next to Teslas $10 billion annual capex (2023). The Chicken Tax gave pricing power but hollowed long-term competitiveness, leaving U.S. EVs expensive and late as Chinas BYD ($9,700 Seagull) and Tesla dominate.

The CHIPS Act: A Blueprint for Revival
Contrast this with the CHIPS Act of 2022a $280 billion initiative ($52 billion in subsidies) to rebuild U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Unlike tariffs, it incentivizes investment: 25% tax credits, grants, and loans lured $325 billion in private commitments by 2025 (Commerce Dept). Intels $20 billion Ohio fabs, TSMCs $65 billion Arizona campus, and Samsungs Texas expansion aim to lift U.S. chip production from 12% to 20% of global supply by 2030. Its created 7,000+ jobs already (SIA 2025), easing chip shortages that cost autos $210 billion in 2021-2022 (AlixPartners).

This isnt protectionismits strategic capacity-building. Chips power EVs, AI, and defense; domestic supply cuts reliance on Taiwan (90% of advanced chips pre-CHIPS). Costs are highU.S. fabs are 40% pricier than Asiasbut the payoff is resilience and innovation (e.g., Intels 18A process by 2025). For autos, its a lifelinecheaper chips could lower EV prices, countering the Chicken Taxs legacy.

Trumps Tariffs: A Blunt Misstep

Enter Trumps 2025 tariffs: 25% on Canada and Mexico, 10% on China and Canadian energy, and threats against Europe. Announced February 1, 2025, they target 40% of U.S. imports (Commerce Dept), aiming to curb fentanyl and boost jobs. But theyre a sledgehammer where precisions needed. Canadas oil (60% of U.S. imports) faces a 10% hike, Mexicos $131 billion in exports 25%, and Chinas $536 billion 10%. Costs spike$2,700 per car (Jefferies 2025), higher food prices (e.g., avocados)and small businesses, reliant on imports, cant pivot like MNCs with global networks.

Inflations the kicker. The Tax Foundation projects a 0.5-1.1% rise, with households losing $1,700-$3,900 yearly (Peterson Institute 2025). Retaliation loomsMexicos peso fell 30% since April 2024, Canadas dollar 8% since Septembersoftening blows but prompting counter-tariffs. Small manufacturers, already hollowed by MNC pricing power, face closure; consumers, less choice. Tariffs prop up big playersFord and GM might gainbut dont rebuild the base. Post-2018 tariffs showed no net job gain (UChicago 2024), just higher prices.

Whats Really Needed: A New Path Forward
Americas manufacturing decline isnt inevitableits a policy failure. Tariffs like the Chicken Tax or Trumps 2025 plan protect yesterdays winners, not tomorrows builders.
 The CHIPS Act shows what works: incentives tied to strategic goals. To turn manufacturing around, heres the playbook:
Repeal the Chicken Tax: Its a 60-year relic. Scrapping it opens the truck market to competition, forcing Ford and GM to innovate, not coast. Imports like Toyotas Hilux could push efficiencyU.S. pickups average 20 mpg vs. global peers 30+. Domestic jobs wont tank; competition spurs adaptation, as Japans 1980s import surge drove Detroits quality leap. EVs benefitlower barriers mean cheaper platforms, not just heavy conversions.

Federal Incentives to States: Hand states grants and tax breaks to attract manufacturing in EVs, batteries, and green tech. Ohios $2 billion EV hub (Ford, Honda) and Georgias $5 billion Rivian plant show scalefederal matching could triple this. Target small firms too: a 2025 CLA report notes SMEs lack capital for retooling; $50 billion in low-interest loans could bridge that, creating 500,000 jobs (extrapolated from CHIPS 20,000).

Strategic Sector Focus: Double down on semiconductors, EV batteries (80% Chinese-made), and renewables. A Battery Act with $100 billion over a decade could mirror CHIPS, aiming for 30% global capacity by 2035. Teslas $7,500 credit worksexpand it to $10,000 for U.S.-made EVs, leveling the field vs. Chinas $9,700 Seagull.

Counter MNC Pricing Power: Tax share buybacks ($1.2 trillion in 2022) at 10%, redirecting funds to R&amp;D. Anti-trust enforcementbreaking Amazons data monopoly or Walmarts supplier squeezerevives small competitors. Subsidize local supply chains: a $5,000-per-job credit for sourcing within 500 miles cuts outsourcings edge.

The Case for Action

Repealing the Chicken Tax ends a distortion thats cost innovationFord and GMs EV lag proves it. Incentives beat tariffs: CHIPS 7,000 jobs dwarf 2018 tariff flops. States, not MNCs, drive growthOhios 2023 manufacturing GDP rose 5% on EV bets (BEA). Strategic focus builds resilience; Chinas battery grip threatens U.S. security. Consumers win toomore competition, lower prices, less inflation (0.5% drop possible, per Nationwide 2025 models).

Conclusion

U.S. corporations pricing powerforged by scale, outsourcing, and policies like the Chicken Taxhas hollowed manufacturing, sidelining small businesses and stunting innovation. Amazons rise and Detroits truck obsession show the cost; Trumps tariffs risk worsening it. The CHIPS Act offers a model: invest, dont obstruct. Repealing the Chicken Tax, incentivizing states, and targeting strategic sectors can rebuild whats been lostnot just factories, but a competitive, future-ready America. The choice is clear: incentivize creation, not consolidation, or watch the hollowing deepen.","economy",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1j1p4yc/pricing_power/"

&gt; **European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash**
&gt; 
&gt; European leaders have rallied behind Volodymyr Zelensky after Donald Trump's furious exchange with the Ukrainian president in the White House.
&gt; 
&gt; The leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ukrainian president has arrived in London to attend a summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who ""retains unwavering support for Ukraine"", Downing Street said.
&gt; 
&gt; It comes after extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office on Friday as US President Trump clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"".
&gt; 
&gt; At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support during Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, and that he was ""gambling with World War Three"".
&gt; 
&gt; As a flurry of supportive messages for Ukraine were posted by European leaders following the row - along with posts from the prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand - Zelensky replied to each one: ""Thank you for your support.""
&gt; 
&gt; French President Emmanuel Macron posted: ""There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.""
&gt; 
&gt; Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine ""now more than ever"", adding: ""We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.""
&gt; 
&gt; Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that ""no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine"", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that ""we stand with Ukraine"" and ""we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war"".
&gt; 
&gt; Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the ""unspeakable"" row resembled a ""bad dream"" and ""underlined that a new age of infamy has begun"".
&gt; 
&gt; She said she would ""wholeheartedly push"" for measures that could help Ukraine ""withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation"".
&gt; 
&gt; Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: ""Ukraine, Spain stands with you,"" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: ""Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.""
&gt; 
&gt; Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada ""will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace"".
&gt; 
&gt; Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had ""proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law"".
&gt; 
&gt; European Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was ""never alone"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,"" they said.
&gt; 
&gt; There were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: ""Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!""
&gt; 
&gt; On Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; He said he was ""not at liberty to say what was discussed"" but shared that he told Zelensky ""we have to respect"" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.
&gt; 
&gt; He said Zelensky must ""find a way"" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart.
&gt; 
&gt; Zelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: ""Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""
&gt; 
&gt; Writing on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was ""very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,"" he added.
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was ""not good for both sides"" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.
&gt; 
&gt; The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.
&gt; 
&gt; Friday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.
&gt; 
&gt; Zelensky responded by asking ""what kind of diplomacy?"", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.
&gt; 
&gt; The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and ""litigating"" the situation in front of the media.
&gt; 
&gt; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit ""without delay"" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; Sir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal.
&gt; 
&gt; The UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This resulted in these posters to talk about how European Union will become the new superpower and that Euros (or maybe even Chinese Yuan) will replace Dollar as the new default global/reserve currency:

&gt; Over the years, I have thought no, India might just creep up, China might even let them, with some mild concessions.
&gt; 
&gt; Though really unions is where it's at.
&gt; 
&gt; Would be really fecking super cool, if there could be, some kind of world union of sorts.
&gt; 
&gt; If a nation is at peace, then it can join, now I know that sounds kind of floaty, it is though one thing, all social cultures have a right to evolve just like our own, even if sometimes we kind of disagree. Peace should be one of the over all factors.
&gt; 
&gt; In time things will flow, if some how people can find a shared goal, away from religion, social hierarchy, greed, status, title and ownership of others, we could hopefully be chilled.
&gt; 
&gt; As common people seem pretty sound with each other, via travel and integration, over much of our history, it does seem like leaders are the issues.

&gt; China supports China. They would go into some strategic alliance if it benefits them. Ukraine would not be wrong to look at a rare earth deal with Europe and China to guarantee their security and Europe would not be wrong to look at closer renewables and EV trade with China as they have massive demand for them, while America goes back to coal and oil.

&gt; Russia and China are allies of convenience only. If Russia ends up on the same side as the US, China will be on the other side of it.

&gt; I think the problem is not encouraging others to have their own security. The problem is how its been handled so far! You could do it diplomatically without sending dog whistle messages to Russia. That sends a clear message to our allies that not just they cant rely on the US militarily but also economically.

https://old.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1j1c1l7/followup_from_my_previous_thread_do_you_expect/mfipuuc/

&gt; The superpowers will be China, India, and EU. Russia is slitting their own throats trying for Ukraine, making deals with China for munitions. India is awash with corruption, as is China.
&gt; 
&gt; Your basic blocks of power will be EU and allies against Russia, China, India and several smaller countries that essentially are owned by China, thanks to their ports and roads ""investments,"" most of africa for example.
&gt; 
&gt; The USA will be without friends. We can't be trusted with any secrets, as any incoming administration can be Trump 2.0 from day 1. Our currency is no longer going to be the fiat currency for the world. About time we faced facts: the Euro is probably going to be the new default global currency.

&gt; There is very realistic threat that US Dollar becomes no longer a reserve currency.

Based on these, do you expect the United States to end up like Venezuela very soon due to a super stagflation, leading to Euro or Chinese Yuan replacing Dollar as the new default global/reserve currency because the United States is deemed untrustworthy after that America/Ukraine situation, leading:

1. South Korea-America Alliance to get abolished entirely and South Korea-China Alliance will be established instead very soon? Why or why not?

2. America-Canada Alliance to get abolished entirely and Canada-China Alliance will be established instead very soon, especially with reports that Canada is about to get thrown out from Five Eyes because they're keep refusing to become the 51st state? Why or why not?

3. America-European Union Alliance to get abolished entirely and China-European Union Alliance will be established instead very soon with America no longer be part of NATO and China joining NATO instead? Why or why not?

"2025-03-01",1740819699,"Energy Transition: the good news, and the bad news","According to Foreign Affairs: ""In 2024 global production of wind and solar energy reached record levelslevels that would have seemed unthinkable not long before. Over the past 15 years, wind and solar have grown from virtually zero to 15 percent of the worlds electricity generation, and solar panel prices have fallen by as much as 90 percent. Such developments represent a notable advance in what is called the energy transitionthe shift from the current hydrocarbon-dominated energy mix to a low-carbon one dominated by renewable sources.

Yet 2024 was a record year in another regard, as well: the amount of energy derived from oil and coal also hit all-time highs. Over a longer period, the share of hydrocarbons in the global primary energy mix has hardly budged, from 85 percent in 1990 to about 80 percent today.""

Most of the fossil fuel companies are changing their plans to rapidly shift to renewable energy, and recommitting to fossil fuel extraction, refining, and sales. Automakers are changing their strategy for EVs, to focus more on hybrids and ICE vehicles for now. Energy consumption is increasing even as appliances, automobiles, robots etc. become more efficient. With data centers and blockchains, for AI and cloud, and cryptocurrencies in developed countries. In developing countries, with rising urbanization and middle class, more people are getting access to electricity, and electrical appliances.

But we should ensure that additional energy demand is met by renewable energy. Because if the trend continues, renewable energy capacity will rise to about 30%, and there will be about a further 90% drop in cost (in solar panels), by 2040. That might make fossil fuels uncompetitive. But with the high upfront costs for renewable energy, developed countries should find a way of using, multilateral institutions, the private sector etc. to make long term loans for solar and wind in developing countries.

With solar and wind, becoming cheaper than oil and coal, the transition to renewable energy is inevitable. But we need to fund sources of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other minerals, necessary for renewable energy and electrification. It takes decades to complete a new project to extract and refine these minerals. So it looks like, for now, we will be dependent on China. So EU and USA better find a way, to make nice with China.

In the fashion industry, for example, workers face the same precarious working conditions regardless of whether they are working with virgin or recycled materials.

And new tensions are emerging over who benefits and loses in the transition to a circular economy. For example, a textile factory owner in the Tamil Nadu region of India voiced concerns that slower fashion cyclespromoted by circular initiatives in wealthier countriescould threaten jobs and livelihoods, making the case (in the words of one interviewee) for ""much faster fashion.""

Among textile manufacturers, secondhand clothing was seen in a negative light as it might decrease the need for new products. The recycling industry, on the other hand, was booming in the same area and was seen as a positive thing. This was reflected in the words of a textile factory manager: ""It's my message (to not) reuse, we can recycle so that we get some work in the future.""

Nevertheless, even recycling was not considered to be a purely positive thing. Many cotton farmers dependent on traditional production face disruption to their livelihoods as recycled textiles gain popularity.""

I am personally discouraged from giving away my old clothes for reuse. Now these are branded clothes which are only one to three years old. I don't want to be throwing clothes in good condition, without any tears or fading or stains. 

I think fast fashion is good, as I like to partially refresh my wardrobe every year. I have always enjoyed shopping. It is almost an addiction. I like new things and new designs, to me fashion is a combination of form and function.

Recently I have also started buying sustainable fashion, or fashion that is made from recycled materials. I think that if you are interested in fashion, you can support the environment, the designers, and manufacturers. By buying premium fashion, which is sustainable, and manufactured in developing countries. And I think you can also help the poor, by directly or indirectly giving them your old clothes.

Fashion retailers should accept their branded used clothes, to be recycled, or given for reuse.

"2025-02-26",1740577403,"Asked AI to predict what the US Debt Crisis might look like:","Imagine a scenario in which President Trump is in office and insists that interest rates fall to stimulate economic growthdespite a backdrop of rising and accelerating inflation. In this hypothetical U.S. crisis, wed see a dramatic policy clash between an expansionary fiscal agenda (featuring massive tax cuts and increased government spending funded by borrowing) and the Federal Reserves commitment to control inflation by raising interest rates. Heres how the crisis might unfold:


1. Policy Mismatch and Market Panic
	""Expansionary Fiscal Shock: Trumps administration would likely push through large unfunded tax cuts and increased borrowing similar in spirit to the UKs mini-budget. The goal would be to spur growth by lowering borrowing costs for businesses and households.
	""Inflation Surge: However, with inflation already risingand expectations that it will acceleratethe combination of expansive fiscal policy and supply constraints would further fuel price increases.
	""Feds Tightening Response: Confronted with persistent and even accelerating inflation, the Federal Reserve would be forced to hike ratespotentially sharplyto rein in price pressures. This rate-hiking stance would be diametrically opposed to Trumps demands for lower rates, setting up an unprecedented standoff.


2. Financial Market Instability
	""Bond Market Volatility: Investors, alarmed by the governments increasing deficits and the disconnect between fiscal policy and the Feds actions, might begin to sell U.S. Treasury bonds. This sell-off would push yields higher. For instance, yields on long-dated Treasuries could spike dramatically, much as gilts did in the UK crisis.
	""Impact on Borrowing Costs: Higher yields would translate into rising mortgage rates and costlier loans for businesses. The resulting increase in borrowing costs could slow down investment and consumer spending, potentially triggering a contraction in economic activity.
	""Pressure on Institutional Investors: Pension funds and insurance companies, which are major buyers of long-term government bonds, might find themselves facing margin calls and liquidity shortages if their bond holdings rapidly decline in value. This could force large-scale deleveraginga doom loop similar to what occurred in the UK.


3. Political and Institutional Conflict
	""Undermining Central Bank Credibility: Trumps persistent public attacks on the Feddemanding that it lower rates to appease his expansionary agendawould challenge the institutions independence. Market participants might begin to question whether monetary policy is being driven by data or political pressure.
	""Political Fallout: This conflict could exacerbate political polarization. If the Fed is seen as bowing to political pressure, or if it steadfastly raises rates despite the presidents demands, investor confidence could erode, affecting not only bond and equity markets but also the overall stability of the U.S. economy.
	""Fiscal Sustainability Concerns: As government debt balloons due to large tax cuts and stimulus measures, the U.S. might face a scenario where rising interest expenses further strain public finances. In extreme cases, this could even lead to a sovereign debt crisisalbeit on a different scale than the UKs, given the dollars global reserve status.


4. Broader Economic Implications
	""Economic Contraction Risks: The sharp rate hikes needed to curb inflation could slow economic growth dramatically, risking a recession. As borrowing costs soar for consumers and businesses alike, spending and investment could dry up.
	""Global Ripple Effects: Because the U.S. dollar is the worlds primary reserve currency, a crisis of this nature wouldnt be contained domestically. Global financial markets would react to a sudden spike in U.S. yields, potentially causing turmoil in international bond markets and exchange rates.
	""Long-Term Structural Damage: Beyond immediate financial market turbulence, a prolonged clash between fiscal and monetary policy could damage the credibility of U.S. economic policymaking. The long-term uncertainty might discourage private investment and complicate efforts to return inflation to target levels.


Conclusion
In short, the U.S. version of a debt-cycle crisismirroring the UKs Truss-era episodewould be characterized by a bitter policy conflict: a president demanding lower rates to boost growth, while rising inflation forces the Fed to hike rates. The resulting divergence would spark bond market panic, increase borrowing costs across the economy, strain institutional investors (especially pension funds), and ultimately risk pushing the economy into recession. Moreover, the political battle over central bank independence could have lasting effects on market confidence and the overall health of the U.S. financial system.
This scenario remains entirely hypothetical. Yet, it illustrates how dramatically different economic outcomes can emerge when fiscal expansion is pursued in an environment where monetary policy must tighten to counter inflationa cautionary tale for policymakers balancing growth with price stability.

"2025-02-26",1740553766,"Trump Launching $5 Million Gold Card Visas For WealthyWhat We Know About New Path To Citizenship","
President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday his administration plans to sell a gold card for $5 million that will provide wealthy non-citizens U.S. residency and a route to citizenship, announcing the visas as he spearheads a mass deportation initiative.


What Will Happen To The Eb-5 Program?
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the card will replace the EB-5 program, which allows immigrants to secure green cards if they create a business and at least 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers. It is unclear if EB-5 visa holders will lose their privileges if the program ends. EB-5 visa usage reached its highest point ever in fiscal year 2024, with at least 12,839 EB-5 visa numbers used through last July, according to State Department data cited by trade organization Invest In The USA. Lutnick also blasted the EB-5 program, calling it full of nonsense and a way to get a green card that was low priced.


What Will The Gold Card Sales Be Used For?
Trump said funds created by the gold card would primarily be used to pay down the national debt, estimating his administration will be able to sell 1 million cards and generate trillions in revenue.


Will The Gold Card Provide U.s. Citizenship?

Not outright, no. If the gold card has the same privileges as the green card, that means wealthy buyers will still lack citizenship rights including the right to vote, the right to run for public office and the right to obtain a U.S. passport. However, being a lawful permanent resident, which one can do with a green card, for at least five years is the most common path to U.S. citizenship, according to Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Tangent

Trump said Russian oligarchs would possibly be eligible for a gold card, adding I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. Lutnick noted those applying for the card will have to go through vetting, of course, adding were going to make sure theyre wonderful world-class global citizens.","economy",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1iyhtph/trump_launching_5_million_gold_card_visas_for/"

"2025-02-25",1740477585,"How to increase home ownership, especially among the poor","According to phys.org: ""Given racial disparities in wealth, these policies would also help to reduce racial gaps in homeownership:

Reform local housing regulations: By easing restrictions on housing development, cities can help alleviate the housing shortage that's helping to drive up home prices. Austin, Texas, is an example of a city that has successfully curbed rising home prices by dramatically increasing its housing construction. Lower house prices would then allow a greater range of families to own homes.

Implement land value taxes: Traditional property taxes can discourage residential development because landowners pay higher taxes after they develop their land. In contrast, land value taxes are only assessed on the value of the land, which encourages landowners to put their land to the most productive use. Over time, land value taxes would lead to greater residential development in areas that need it most, which would then reduce upward pressures on house prices.

Subsidize homeownership: While using federal funds to subsidize homeownership would come with the risk of inflating prices, this could help more low-income households enter and maintain homeownership and thereby benefit from future housing market appreciation.""

Everyone should have a home. Rich and poor. I am a capitalist, who believes in meritocracy, but I believe a rich country with a lot of land, should ensure that everyone has a home. If they can, they should ensure that everyone is allocated land at birth. And the children can build their own homes when they grow up. I must confess that I was a socialist when growing up, but over time I became familiar with both socialism and neoliberalism. My preferences vary based on the environment or nation, and my personal circumstances.

But like I explained in USA where I did my MBA, even though it is an individualistic country, it has a large social welfare system like most developed economies. I think there should be basic rights for everyone, any more than that, is on your individual initiative.

Some investors argue this trend has brought many of the worlds best companies to the US and will make the market more resilient to an economic downturn.""

The stock market survived the pandemic, with tech companies benefiting. But can tech companies survive the brutal cutting of government spending combined with a trade war with the rest of the world? 

About two thirds of the global stock market capitalisation is in USA. Of which, nearly a third is due to big tech seven. But the US stock market includes many foreign companies, and domestic companies with a large percentage of their profits due to foreign sales. So if you are invested in the broad US market, is there any need to diversify?

Concentrated investment is like leverage. When things go right, you make huge gains, but when things go wrong, you make huge losses. So don't put all your eggs in one basket, unless you have knowledge or expertise that most retail investors don't. 

Right now, I would increase allocations to EU and China. And also look at other asset classes, like crypto, metals, and real estate.

Both sides seek to bolster collaboration in technology such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, according to a draft statement seen by the FT.

The visit will also pave the way for more concrete results at an EU-India summit later this year. That summit aims to raise the relationship to a higher strategic level, Kumar said. It is good that there is greater interest in the EU towards India.'

Hopefully this friendship will be good for India. In terms of human rights, like freedom, security, and privacy. But I have never lived in EU. I don't know the ground reality of human rights protection in EU: how much of it is propoganda, and how much of it is truth.

But cooperation in technology will be good to help them share knowledge, funding, and markets, to help them compete with USA and China.

There is also defence cooperation. Perhaps they can buy arms from each other, share dual use technology, share intelligence, and have defense exercises together.

But to me, the sticking point, is human rights. India has become more autocratic with a decline in freedom, privacy, security etc. over the last decade. And the global media that is Western doesn't report enough on the human rights problems in the West, since the start of this decade. What use is more income and wealth, if you are not secure, if you are not free to spend it as you wish, if you are not free to travel where you want?

The importing countrys businesses and consumers typically bear the major portion of tariffs, not the exporting country. Heres how it works:

	""	Businesses in the importing country (e.g., U.S. companies) pay the tariff when they bring in goods from abroad. These costs are often passed down the supply chain.

	""	Consumers face higher prices as businesses adjust prices to offset tariff costs.

	""	Exporting companies may absorb some of the cost by lowering prices to stay competitive, but this depends on demand elasticity.

Example: U.S.-China Tariffs

When the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, U.S. importers paid the duties, often passing costs to businesses and consumers in the form of higher prices. Some companies sought alternative suppliers to reduce costs.

Bottom Line: Tariffs are effectively a tax on domestic buyers rather than a direct penalty on foreign sellers.

"2025-02-28",1740705436,"Economists Warn of Policy Risks: Key Indicators to Watch","As of February 27, 2025, over a month into the new U.S. administrations term, prominent economists are raising concerns about policies enacted since January 20, including significant tariffs and federal workforce reductions. Below, we outline their warnings and the critical data points they recommend monitoring.

Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moodys Analytics, cautions that the 10% tariff on Chinese importsalongside proposed 25% levies on Mexico and Canadaand swift cuts via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) threaten economic growth and inflation. He advises tracking consumer confidence, which fell to an eight-month low in February per the Conference Board, and import prices, a leading inflation indicator likely to rise as tariffs take hold.

Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate at Columbia University, highlights risks from trade restrictions and immigration policies, predicting labor shortages in key sectors. He points to labor force participation and wage growth, suggesting close attention to the unemployment rate (4.2% in late 2024) and BLS job vacancy data for signs of tightening labor markets that could elevate costs and curb GDP growth.

Diane Swonk, Chief Economist at KPMG, warns of inflationary pressures complicating Federal Reserve policy, with the federal funds rate at 4.25%4.5%. She flags Treasury yields and inflation expectations, noting Januarys 3.0% CPI and Februarys 4.3% consumer expectations (University of Michigan). The 10-year Treasury yield, projected at 4.5%, could climb if fiscal expansion unnerves bond markets.

Carmen Reinhart, Harvard professor and former World Bank chief economist, focuses on potential poverty increases driven by job cuts and higher consumer prices. She recommends monitoring real income growth and poverty metrics, particularly BLS wage data for low-income workers and forthcoming Census poverty updates, to assess impacts on vulnerable households.","economy",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1izvxrz/economists_warn_of_policy_risks_key_indicators_to/"

***Photo above -*** *there's a new ""worst American car"" - the $100,000 Rivian R1T. It dethroned the previous champion, the Jeep Wrangler. Make American Cars Great Again!*  
  
Full disclosure: I drive an American MADE car. A Honda Civic Hybrid. But not an American designed car. In the link below are the ratings for Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge, Lincoln, Chrysler, Jeep, GMC and newcomer Rivian. How Tesla managed to stay off this list, I dont know. All the online reviews  including Consumer Reports  complain about shoddy assembly and breakdowns.  
  
Im supportive of our president  whether its Biden or Trump  trying to encourage us to buy US made products. But what if those products have been crappy for generations? And we continue to buy them only because of tax rebates, federal factory partnerships, bailouts, and mind-boggling UAW contracts?  
  
My rant is going to get worse. First Biden, and now Trump, have better put imported vehicles in their tariff crosshairs. At one point Biden wanted a 100% tax on anything made in China. I dont know what Trump;s tariff demand is at the moment . . . it seems to change daily. Are we at war with Canada or not? Over cars? If we want to stop Fentanyl smuggling, there was probably a simpler way.  
  
Mr. Trump . . . if you believe in the free market, smaller government, and corporate survival of the fittest, you know what you have to do. Stop all this tariff nonsense. Stop giving tax subsidies to ANYTHING, no matter where its made. End all the federal partnerships on EV factories, green hydrogen, blue ammonia, and whatever else is being whispered in your ear.  
  
All those things are just raising the price of US made cars or raising the national debt as we transfer budget dollars to try and keep Detroit afloat.  
  
Thats what tariffs and subsidies do . . . save Detroit. Thats why Biden tried a Hail Mary pass his last year in office  doubling the tax rebates on (US made) EVs in many cases. This was never about saving the planet. It was always about saving the worst carmakers on earth.

"2025-02-28",1740716968,"No one is talking about where the tariffs will go.","There are lots of articles and headlines about who pays the tarrif (it's the importing company) and will it affect consumer prices ( it will). This will result in less qty of everything being imported because it costs 25% more, higher prices for consumers, and more scarcity as there will simply be less of everything, and less purchases by consumers because everything isote expensive. All very bad stuff, lots to discuss.

But, I have yet to see anyone talking about where all that money will go. I think a lot of people, like me, at least initially assume that it will be collected by the USA govt, and will be deposited into the govt Treasury. But the more I see on exactly what Trump/musk/DOGE is doing, the more I begin to suspect that income  will not end up there. And it will be a lot of money.

I'm curious as to anyone who has any thoughts on this or has read anything on this.","economy",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1izzhs0/no_one_is_talking_about_where_the_tariffs_will_go/"

"2025-03-03",1741012361,"The Selling of America: How Trumps Financial Empire, Foreign Influence, and Power Consolidation Are Killing U.S. Democracy","Donald Trump is not just running a governmenthe is running a business. His presidency has become a for-profit enterprise, fueled by a financial empire that allows foreign actors, wealthy insiders, and political operatives to buy influence over U.S. policy. Through Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), the $TRUMP cryptocurrency, a systematic pro-Russia policy shift, and an aggressive consolidation of power, Trump is transforming the presidency into a private financial asset.

This is not politics. This is not governance. This is the outright sale of American foreign and domestic policy to the highest bidder.

What makes this moment uniquely dangerous is that Trump is actively dismantling the very institutions that would hold him accountable. He is not just benefiting from foreign financial investmentshe is ensuring that no law enforcement agency, regulatory body, or independent oversight group can stop him.

The question is no longer whether Trump is corrupt. The question is whether the U.S. presidency has already been privatized, monetized, and sold off in pieces to those who stand to gain from his rule.

1/ The Financial Pipeline: How TMTG and $TRUMP Allow Foreign Influence Over the U.S. Government

TMTG: A $6 Billion Political Investment Vehicle
- TMTGs 2024 revenue was just $3.6 million, yet the company is valued at nearly $6 billion.
- Foreign financial entities, including state-backed investors, have disclosed investments in TMTG, raising questions about whether adversarial nations are using stock purchases to gain influence over Trump.

If foreign actors are buying up TMTG stock, they do not need to send briefcases of cash or hold secret meetings. They are directly enriching Trump through the stock market, ensuring that his policies align with their interests.

Trump Coin ($TRUMP): The Untraceable Bribery Mechanism
- TRUMPs value surged 300% overnight after its launch, reaching a peak market cap of $12 billion.
- Approximately 80% of the tokens are controlled by Trump-affiliated entities, meaning price increases directly benefit him.

Unlike TMTG, Trump Coin operates in a completely unregulated environment. It is a perfect tool for financial influence-peddling, allowing foreign actors to secretly funnel money into Trumps ecosystem without detection.
- A Russian oligarch, a Gulf state prince, or a Chinese government-backed investor could purchase millions of $TRUMP tokens, inflating its value and making Trump personally wealthierall without ever being identified.
- Unlike campaign donations, which are limited and must be disclosed, there is no cap on how much money can flow through $TRUMP.
- Trumps direct control over the tokens release schedule means he can time policy announcements to benefit his own holdings.

This is not a hypothetical scenario. It is already happening.

2/ The Payoff: Trumps Policy Shifts Directly Benefit Russia and His Financial Backers

Since TMTGs stock price surged and Trump Coin skyrocketed in value, Trumps foreign policy has shifted dramatically toward Russia.

Key Moves Benefiting Russia:

Blocking U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine
- Despite bipartisan congressional support for continued military aid to Ukraine, Trump has actively blocked or delayed assistance, claiming that Europe should pay more.
- This directly benefits Vladimir Putins war strategy, weakening Ukraines defenses and increasing Russias leverage over NATO.

Opposition to a UN Resolution Condemning Russia
- The Trump administration was one of the few governments to oppose a UN resolution blaming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Potential Lifting of Sanctions &amp; New Russian Business Deals
- Reports indicate that Trump has privately discussed lifting U.S. sanctions on Russian businesses, citing major economic development opportunities with Moscow.
- U.S. investors and Putins allies are reportedly in talks to reactivate the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a move that would increase European dependence on Russian energy.

3/ Shutting Down Oversight: How Trump Is Consolidating Power to Protect Himself

Trump is not just benefiting from foreign investments and crypto speculationhe is actively consolidating power to ensure he is never held accountable.

Appointing Loyalists to Key Positions

Control Over Law Enforcement:
- Kash Patel as FBI Director  Patel has openly stated his desire to clean house at the FBI, raising concerns that he will block investigations into Trumps financial dealings.
- Pam Bondi as Attorney General  A longtime Trump ally, Bondi has already shut down previous investigations into Trump businesses and now oversees the DOJ.

Control Over Financial Regulators:
- Trumps Executive Order on Agency Oversight now grants the White House increased authority over independent regulatory agencies, such as the SEC and FTC.
- By forcing these agencies to align with White House priorities, Trump ensures that no meaningful investigation into TMTG or $TRUMP can take place.

4/ Potential Legal Violations: Has Trump Crossed the Line?

Trumps merging of personal wealth with public policy raises serious legal questions. His financial dealings may violate multiple U.S. laws, including:
- Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)  If foreign investors are using TMTG stock or $TRUMP purchases to influence Trumps decision-making, it may constitute an indirect form of bribery.
- The Emoluments Clause  If foreign state-backed investors are purchasing Trump-affiliated assets, this may be an unconstitutional foreign financial benefit to a sitting president.
- Securities Fraud (SEC Rule 10b-5)  If Trump-affiliated entities are artificially inflating TMTGs stock price through manipulated investments, it may be a violation of federal securities laws.
- Campaign Finance Violations (FECA)  If foreign nationals are using TMTG investments or Trump Coin purchases to financially support Trump, this may be an illegal foreign campaign contribution.
- Money Laundering (Bank Secrecy Act)  If foreign actors are using $TRUMP to funnel money into Trump-affiliated entities, this could constitute financial crimes.

5/ The Bottom Line: Has the U.S. Presidency Been Privatized?
- Trump has created a system where foreign actors can enrich him personally through stock and crypto investments.
- He has dismantled oversight, ensuring no government agency can investigate his financial dealings.
- He is making policy decisions that directly benefit those financially invested in his empire.

This is not just corruptionit is the transformation of American democracy into an authoritarian financial empire.

What Must Happen Now?
- Congress must investigate Trumps financial dealings and foreign investments in TMTG and $TRUMP.
- Laws must be passed to prohibit sitting presidents from launching private financial assets.
- Independent regulators must be protected from White House interference.

If no action is taken, the presidency will no longer belong to the American people. It will belong to whoever is willing to pay the highest price.","economy",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1j2jyb0/the_selling_of_america_how_trumps_financial/"

"2025-02-27",1740648143,"Should bank executives be held financially responsible for risky or negligent conduct, that results in bank failure?","According to phys.org: ""The researchers specifically propose a framework that would apply financial penalties to executives at all U.S. bankswhether publicly traded or privately heldwhen their negligent actions significantly contribute to a bank collapse or require emergency government intervention. Their recommended sanction is a clawback of up to five years' worth of total compensation, with enhanced penalties for gross negligence or misconduct.""

The focus should be C level executives and board of directors, for clawing back pay. And I don't think base pay should be clawed back. Only bonuses or monetary gains due to exercising stock options, should be an option to claw back compensation. Furthermore we can also look at clawing back bonuses or options related compensation, for those whose base pay is less than 50% of their total pay, or their extra pay is more than two million dollars, like traders.

To protect shareholders and other stakeholders, banks must have risk management as a key cross functional process. But risk models, failed during the financial crisis; because it is based on historical data. Events that were predicted to not even happen in hundreds of thousands of years were happening. That is why it is key for banks to be stress tested by the regulators. And follow latest Basel requirements.

"2025-02-26",1740612209,"The cumulative effects of the current US government will hit the consumer","The Trump administration is currently impacting the economy in ways that could have massive consequences, with one key theme: the average U.S. consumer will take a significant hit.


1. Federal Workers Laid Off

While trimming the workforce can benefit the economy in the long run, doing so abruptly can send a shockwave through the system. Even workers on solid contracts are facing sudden terminations, which could lead many to default on loans and mortgages.

Adding around 200,000 unemployed workers (a rough estimate) almost overnightwithout a gradual transition into new jobswill likely reduce overall consumer spending.


2. Tariffs

While foreign manufacturers may eventually lower prices to offset tariffs, that adjustment wont happen immediately. International contracts take time to renegotiate, meaning that in the short term, American consumers will bear the brunt of these costs.


3. Medicaid Cuts

Reducing Medicaid funding will inevitably increase healthcare costs for the average American. Since medical bills are a leading cause of foreclosures, these cuts will likely exacerbate financial instability for many households.


4. Tax Cuts

While the wealthiest Americans will see tax benefits, inflation will likely erode much of their purchasing power. Meanwhile, middle- and lower-income consumers may see little to no relief.


5. Discouraging Immigrant Labor

Although deportation numbers are not yet significantly higher than during the Obama era, the fear and uncertainty surrounding immigration policies have led many undocumented workers to avoid showing up for jobs. This labor shortage could contribute to rising inflation, particularly in industries reliant on immigrant labor.


The Real Concern
The U.S. economy is resilient enough to absorb one or two of these effects in isolation. However, the real danger lies in these factors converging within a short period.

If these policies move forward as planned, consumers will likely begin to feel the impact by May, and economic growth forecasts for Q3 could be revised downward.

"2025-03-03",1741008969,"Sorry Elon, youre wrong. Social Security isnt a Ponzi scheme . . . (yet)","https://preview.redd.it/yovsgx699hme1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=525aec17284d2ce0d2e721522c0f62fc105e3196

***Photo above*** *- some politicians are saying the only way to fix social security is through huge increases in immigration. But that has the problem backwards . . . it won't be fixed through more minimum wage workers who will eventually expect benefit checks.*  
  
Social security wasn't designed as a Ponzi scheme. It was well intentioned , but dreamed up by a bunch of politicians who were notoriously bad at math. The chief architect was FDR. A millionaire who inherited his fortune, and never had to work at a real job. He joined a prestigious white shoe NYC law firm DESPITE dropping out of law school. Wikipedia is mute on whether he ever took a college level accounting course, business, economics, or math. FDR attended Harvard, and about all we really know is that he worked on the school newspaper and was a cheerleader. He got mediocre grades.  
  
To someone unfamiliar with math, Social Security looked like a winner when it was created in 1935. Collect a small amount from everybodys paycheck. Put it in a trust fund, but dont pay out any benefits for 5 years. And the average American lifespan was so short, the odds of collecting any sizeable amount were hilariously small.  
  
Fast forward 90 years to 2025. There are now fewer workers contributing for every social security recipient. In 1960 the ratio was twice as high. You can thank medical miracles that help us live longer, but also thank those politicians who were too dumb to see that under ANY circumstances social security benefits would outgrow contributions.  
  
What happens when the Social Security trust fund is depleted? Either benefits will be cut (a lot), or Social Security taxes will go up (a lot). You and I probably wont get to vote on this . . . it will be decided in some backroom by senators whose average age is 64, average income is north of $200,000, and average net worth is more than $1 million. Youre guess is as good as mine what they will end up deciding. Whatever it is, it wont reflect the financial realities of ordinary Americans.  
  
So if benefits ARE cut (by 35% or more, on some scenarios) what does that mean? A bunch of people are going to receive LESS in benefits than they actually paid into the system in taxes. **THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A PONZI SCHEME!** The first guys in make out like bandits, and the last guys through the door never even get their original money back. It was never intended to be like this. Social Security was concocted millionaires who were bad at math, but good at understanding how to harvest votes for re-election.  
  
And it's not only a problem with Social Security. Winning re-election is what informs virtually ALL the spending decisions congress makes. Which is why we have $36 trillion in national debt. The entire US government is a ponzi scheme. They use inflation to try and outrun the national debt, so the prices we pay rise faster than income and savings. You only come out ahead if you own land, gold, bitcoin, or a company with government contracts.  
  
Mr. Musk . . . I feel your pain. But whining that the Social Security Trust Fund will soon be insolvent is counterproductive. Youre not even speaking truth to power. Show us the solution. And no . . . its NOT going to involve a tidal wave of new minimum wage immigrants who will begin paying social security taxes. THOSE people are going to need benefits 30+ years down the road, and were going to be worse off than when we started. We cant overpopulate ourselves out of disaster. Do the effin' math this time . . .  
  
Im just sayin . . .

It's all unfolding amid emerging backlash to what's happening elsewhere as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk is tearing through federal agencies with his Department of Government Efficiency firing thousands of workers nationwide, and angry voters are starting to confront lawmakers at town hall meetings back home.

          it will pile onto debt because the cost of the tax breaks  at least $4.5 trillion over the decade outweighs the $2 trillion in spending cuts to government programs.

***Photo above -*** *somebody calling themself ""Satoshi Takimoto"" is the world's largest holder of Bitcoins. He's shy about being photographed. He has over 1 million coins, worth approximately $100 Billion (with a B). But there isn't any paper trail of tax returns, so this story might be bogus too.*  
  
Finally! Evidence of economic progress from the Trump administration. Crypto is crashing. Im not going to give Trump all the credit, but his ongoing affection for meme coins, Musk, and a US national cryptocurrency - to try and pay off the national debt - certainly are playing a part. Putin, and Chairman Xi of China, you can take a bow too. And whoever hacked $1 billion in Bitcoin from a North Korean bunker this week.  
  
Bitcoin was $78,000 a few minutes ago. It was $96,000 a week ago. It was $106,000 at the start of the month. (see link below). To experience this much risk and volatility, you would have to go all in on speculative tech stocks like Nvidia, Super Micro Computer, or a Lithium mining company that so far has failed to bring any of the stuff to the surface (Piedmont Lithium - PLL - down from $78 a share to around $7). Dont put all your eggs in one basket. Especially if it has negative cash flow or doesnt produce any tangible goods.  
  
Another problem: Bitcoin is thinly traded by a handful of whales. The top 1,000 holders have about half the total bitcoins. 95% of us (54 million wallets) have less than $10,000 each. I dont think anyone outside of the top 1,000 guys has any actual influence on Bitcoin's market price. So, if Bitcoin is down 20% this week alone, theyre probably in a dark web group chat plotting something, no?  
  
Another problem  Bitcoin mining (just Bitcoin, not counting all the other 600+ crypto flavors) has a carbon footprint the size of Argentina. In fact, mining uses more electricity than 160 countries. Reminder  bitcoin mining doesnt produce food, clothing, or shelter. Bitcoin simply eats electricity and spits out blockchain equations. It's possibly linked to poverty, homelessness, and hunger.  
  
Despite what someone is sure to rant in a reply, I am NOT a gold bug either. I won't try to calculate the carbon footprint of all the actively worked gold mines. But gold doesnt produce food, clothing or shelter either. It goes into vaults, and to a lesser extent wedding rings.  
  
Im not telling anyone to rush for the exits if theyre already sitting on 1 bitcoin (or a fractional amount) and are getting nervous. After every crash there is a rally. Then another crash, and so on. So the millions of Bitcoin holders have some breathing room, even if they can never control their own fate. You can't ""vote your shares"" to change the trajectory and business plan of the company.  
  
We just better pray that bitcoin mining - and AI, and tax subsidized EVs - dont use up all the electricity. If theres a blackout, then bitcoin mining stops, and the value REALLY crashes. But people probably wont care. Theyll be too worried about the food rotting in their refrigerators, no water pressure, and freezing temperatures in their homes.  
  
Im just sayin . . .

At first VERY funny, and then VERY sad&

Marketgate with a sequel

Act 1.  (the funny part) On September 1, 2019, when Hurricane Dorian was approaching the USA, Trump decided to warn people. On Twitter, he heroically wrote that it threatened Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and... Alabama. The only problem was that Alabama was not threatened at all at that time. But who would check the little things?
The people of Alabama, of course! They began to call the local weather service en masse with the question: ""Is this true?!"" To which the forecasters politely replied: ""Hello, no! Alabama is out of the game!""
Instead of calmly admitting this, Trump decided to act. A few days later he showed reporters a map with a hurricane forecast, on which someone had drawn an arc - so that Alabama was near the hurricane zone.
There was even a NOAA employee, Neil Jacobs, who came out with a statement, saying, ""well, theoretically, some winds could be there."" The scientific community did not appreciate this idea, and an investigation began inside the agency: who forced scientists to cover up the forecasts with a marker? Because forging official weather forecasts in the US is punishable by a fine or up to 90 days in prison. In June 2020, an internal investigation found that Neil Jacobs violated the NOAA code of ethics by supporting Trump's statement.

Act 2. (Now the sad part). Now NOAA is undergoing mass layoffs - 800 employees have already lost their jobs, and this is just the beginning. 
Almost all departments of the agency were hit: weather experts, hurricane researchers, oceanologists, tsunami wave researchers, biodiversity experts, climate researchers, engineers and programmers.
Do you know who headed NOAA? I think you've already guessed it  the hero of Markergate is Neil Jacobs. 

We expect the black marker methodology to become the main tool for forecasting hurricanes, tsunamis and climate change. 

And here we are, fighting plagiarism together.
UPD: the last phrase is by no means an excuse for plagiarism, but serves to demonstrate the difference between our values and theirs in the context of recent dramatic political events.","ukraine",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1j2fp9f/kateryna_terletska_on_science_and_trump_translated/"

https://nos.nl/collectie/13985/artikel/2557791-navo-baas-rutte-zelensky-moet-relatie-met-trump-herstellen

Translation:

Ukrainian President Zelensky must ensure that the relationship with the American president is restored quickly. That says NATO boss Rutte after the hard clash yesterday between Zelensky and Trump in the White House.

Rutte calls the confrontation in the Oval Office 'unfortunate': ""I don't think Trump was looking for a fight."" According to Rutte, Zelensky and Trump first had a good conversation for half an hour. Then, according to Rutte, it was ""misforte wrong"", after which they fly ""full of each other in the hair"".

The NATO chief said he had contact with the Ukrainian president: What I have told Zelensky is that we should respect what Trump has done so far. Rutte says Zelensky must now find ""a way to restore the relationship with Trump"".

Rutte says he is convinced that Trump would also like a ""lasting peace"" in Ukraine. What is needed is that we all work together: Europe, Ukraine and the United States.
US remains committed to NATO

Rutte also emphasized that the United States is the leader in NATO. The NATO chief said Thursday that he had called Trump for another half an hour and he is convinced that the US president is committed to the military alliance. According to Rutte, the US is ""totally"" committed to NATO, ""also as regards Article 5"". That article stipulates that an attack on one of the NATO countries is seen as an attack on all allies.

Rutte also underlined that in 2019 it was Trump who sent Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, which then helped Ukraine three years ago stop the Russians in the invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky and Trump came together yesterday to make a deal on Ukrainian raw materials, but that did not happen. During the meeting and in front of journalists, a quarrel between Zelensky and Trump and Vice President Vance came to a quarrel.

Zelensky called the incident afterwards in an interview with Fox News ""not good"", but refused to apologize. On X, he repeated today that he is ""very grateful"" for all American support. Trump said he was no longer interested in a commodity deal and says Zelensky has overplayed his hand. According to Trump, Zelensky is only welcome back to the White House ""when he is ready for peace"".

Tomorrow European Summit in London

Tomorrow, European leaders will meet in London led by British Prime Minister Starmer. Zelensky is also present. According to Rutte, it is important that the countries agree on security guarantees when it comes to an agreement with Russia.

We do not want war forever, but a lasting peace. In addition, it is important that Putin or his successor never dares to lift a finger in an agreement.""","ukraine",61,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1j17kqy/secretary_general_of_nato_zelensky_must_restore/"

I have been following closely the stories on the US request for mineral rights from Ukraine. The only reason I see that Ukraine is interesting in this arrangement is because, by default, the US would want to protect its assets which is a way around the US committing to support against Putin.

Is that logic sound? Am I missing another reason to continue these discussions? As have been said over and over, I don't see what Ukraine gets out of this arrangement other than payback with 500% interest.","ukraine",71,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1ixg3vk/mineral_rights/"

The letter in full:

I am deeply disturbed by the direction and rhetoric of the administration regarding the sovereignty of Canada, Ukraine, and Europe. While the US President Donald Trump has taken an increasingly adversarial stance towards Canada, Europe, and Ukraine, accusing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of gambling with World War IlI, European leaders have rallied behind Ukraine and Canada.  It is clearly evident that there is a growing rift between the US and our Canadian and European allies on these issues. Europe seems determined to stand by Ukraine and NATO, even if it means charting its own course separate from Washington's alignment with Russia. The European Union's foreign policy chief has declared that the free world needs new leadership, implying a shift away from American alliances; all while being targeted by a ruthless alliance of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Maintaining a united front with our European partners is crucial for upholding the principles of democracy, self-determination, and collective security enshrined in the NATO alliance, and the Constitution of the United States.  A strong, coordinated repudiation of the Trump administrations rhetoric and actions towards Canada, Europe and Ukraine is vital to securing American interests.  A strong, coordinated response in support of Ukraine's resistance against Russian aggression is necessary to deter further violations of international law and preserve the rules-based order in Europe, and the North American continent.  I urge you speak out publicly against undermining our allies and that you openly stand with our Canadian, European, and Ukrainian allies, and acknowledge the threats to their national sovereignty.","ukraine",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1j2aa55/letter_to_the_us_congress_telling_them_to_support/"

This will be a big update with a lot to cover, so buckle up. Thank you to the mod team here also for adding me as an approved user so these posts don't get caught up in any Automod snafus anymore.

**Video of the Week:**

https://reddit.com/link/1izj9gs/video/uu792ia25ple1/player

* This video shows intense close combat trench clearing operations by Ukrainian soldiers. Actions like this are being taken by Ukrainian troops all over the front every single day.

**Analysis on Peace Negotiations and Trump Actions:**

* There is no charitable way for me to interpret recent Trump administration actions on Ukraine negotiations. At best, they can be described as confused or even schizophrenic, and at worst, it does seem like Trump is choosing to side with Russia and supports many of their talking points. The absolutely shameful vote in the UN where the US sided with Russia and refused to call them an aggressor is the lowest point in US foreign policy since the invasion of Iraq.
* The only even somewhat positive spins I've seen on this are that either this is an attempt to lull Putin into a false sense of confidence, or that is an attempt to try and separate Putin from China by giving him space.  Even if those are the motivations behind these actions, they are stupid motivations that simply give up a lot of negotiating power for no good reason.
* The mineral deal and the way that was handled was also atrocious, it was incredibly insulting for Treasury Secretary Bessent to demand Zelensky sign a far-reaching document during a random meeting. The full text of the agreement that was eventually signed was leaked, and it's extremely vague seems to exist to give Trump a way to say he is making Ukraine pay for the US contribution to the war, even though the agreement I read didn't seem to have any tightly binding clauses or any real specifics. I don't think Zelensky has actually given up much of anything at all by signing it, and once again he has handled this whole situation extremely well in my opinion, standing firm when that was necessary while giving ground when that became the right decision. I maintain that Zelensky will be viewed by history as one of the greatest wartime leaders of any democracy ever.
* One other way in which all of this can be viewed somewhat positively is that Europe has finally been jolted into taking much more responsibility for its own defense and the defense of Ukraine. While European nations have already contributed a lot to Ukraine, it is a reality that they have the most to lose from Ukraine falling, and so they should contribute the most to Ukraine's defense, especially since they have freeloaded off of American military might for so many decades.
* We are now seeing European leaders, in particular Starmer in the UK, Macron in France, and the soon to be new Chancellor in Germany Merz make very significant comments about boosting European defense and support for Ukraine. The European commission is considering the creation of a multiple hundred billion Euro fund similar to the one put together for COVID that will be distributed among EU nations for building up their militaries.
* In the end, there are several things that are clear to me: Europe will not abandon Ukraine, the US cannot be relied on any more as a bulwark against authoritarian leaders, and Ukraine should not and will not accept any peace deal that is negotiated purely between the US and Russia. Especially with the all the money Europe is plowing into defense, I am confident that Europe and Ukraine together will be able to sustain the Ukrainian military for the foreseeable future, especially because US military aid to Ukraine has not been cut off yet and the Biden administration already signed many contracts that have not been cancelled for continuing support.
* I have become much more bearish on the prospect of the US peace negotiations with Russia working out, I think it's far more likely that the talks eventually fall apart because Putin is not capable of good faith negotiations and has many reasons to want to continue the war. And peace deal that will eventually be signed will have to have Ukrainian support, and will surely include European peacekeeping forces, strong security guarantees from European nations, EU membership and a possible path to NATO membership for Ukraine, and the maintenance or even further enlargement of the Ukrainian military which is and will continue to be a lynchpin of European security. None of what has happened in the past few weeks has diminished my firm belief that Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty will survive the war, even as they may still have to make a very bitter compromise on their territorial integrity.

* Russia has managed to make their most major advance in a while on this front, pushing away Ukrainian troops in the western part of this sector and apparently making an advance into Ukrainian territory here. While we don't know how far they've gotten and may well be pushed back immediately, this is a dangerous advance that does threaten the whole salient if the Russians can make it to the Ukrainian roads that supply the salient.

* Russia advanced here to seize the town of Dvorichna, and also advanced east of Borova.

* No major changes here though heavy fighting is ongoing.

Pokrovsk two weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/934l0tzjaple1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351e903dc0dcd86a65fce3f9719a7cddbdb0b756

* As I expected, Russia has finally managed to fully close the salient west of Kurakhove, though it did take them a long time to do it. The Ukrainian counter-attack against the Russian salient southwest of Pokrovosk has unfortunately failed to take any more ground and doesn't seem likely execute any kind of encirclement of attacking Russian forces. Heavy fighting near Toretsk is also continuing.

Velyka Novosilka two weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/pw7lvjszaple1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2cc5ce54298adebd0a144e07eba0e31251c8793

Velyka Novosilka this week:

* Russia advanced slightly north of Velyka Novosilka, though I've read the terrain in that area is much more favorable for defense, so they have been moving more slowly there than they were before.

**Other Events This Week:**

* Ukraine's highly successful drone strike campaign has continued unabated, with big strikes against another large Russian refinery and a strike against a Russian ammo depot in Toropets that caused a massive explosion which some sources claimed destroyed up to half of Russia's 122mm shell stockpile. This campaign has been the single most impactful operation Ukraine has undertaken in the last few months, and I think its successes have been under-reported in Western media. Russia has consistently shown a very poor ability to defend against these strikes, while Ukrainian drones just keep getting better. It's also been a great opportunity for Ukraine to define itself against Russia, as the Russian drone and missile strike campaign consistently targets civilian objects, while the Ukrainian campaign has very strictly been limited to hitting legitimate military and industrial targets.
* Forbes contributor David Axe, who it should be noted has a history of making non-credible claims and reports, has written that Ukraine has found a way to jam Russian GLONASS GPS-like systems all along the front, dramatically affecting the capability of Russian glide bomb strikes. If this is true, this represents a major reprieve for Ukrainian soldiers as those glide bombs have been extremely deadly and effective so far.
* Ukrainian F-16s were observed flying loaded for ground strikes for the first time so far in the war. Previously they had been limited to the air defense role, shooting down cruise missiles. Several French Mirage-2000 planes are also in the process of being delivered, or possibly have already been delivered. These planes will play a crucial role as Storm Shadow cruise missile launchers, augmenting Ukraine's aging Su-24 fleet which has been the main platform for those missiles so far.
* German artillery ammunition production is continuing to increase, and they are planning on delivering 370,000 shells to Ukraine in 2025, which is both a significant number of shells, and not enough. If combined with deliveries from other nations such as the UK and France, which have both stepped up ammo production as well, could be enough to keep Ukraine's artillery firing even without US support, though every additional shell helps. For what it's worth, we haven't seen any evidence of the US cutting off artillery ammunition, and indeed that would make no sense even from a purely American perspective, as we've already invested a lot of money into increasing production, and we'll need that increased production for any confrontation with China, but if they cut off the money than that capability will atrophy again.
* Both the UK and the EU announced multi-billion dollar aid packages to Ukraine for delivery in March. The UK one is the biggest we've ever seen from them with a total value of $5.6 billion. This also comes along with Starmer announcing a significant increase of the UK defense budget (though it's still not enough of an increase).
* Ukrainian military leaders have now claimed that Ukraine is the largest producer of drones in the world, with 96% of drones used by the UAF made in Ukraine. They also said that 85% of strikes that have destroyed Russian equipment and personnel are done by drones. \\
* Ukrainian leaders are also signaling confidence that Russia is nearing the limit of what it can bear financially and militarily from the war, with huge manpower and equipment losses, rising inflation, tougher sanctions, the drone strike campaign, and other factors coming together to put Russia in an increasingly tough position. Newest estimates say Russia is closing in one 1 million total casualties (killed and severely wounded), with between 160 to 200 thousand of those having been killed, which are staggering losses.

**Oryx Numbers (remember that this is for two weeks, so numbers will be high):**

* Total Russian vehicle losses: 20,551 (+242)
* Russian tank losses: 3,783 (+39)
* Russian IFV losses: 5,545 (+78)
* Russian SPG losses: 891 (+10)
* Russian SAM losses: 300 (+0)
* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)
* Russian Aircraft losses: 136 (+0)
* Russian Helicopter losses: 151 (+0)
* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 7,937 (+123)
* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,085 (+15)
* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,226 (+12)
* Ukrainian SPG losses: 473 (+10)
* Ukrainian SAM losses: 167 (+1)

Average or slightly high Russian losses the past two weeks, and average or slightly low Ukrainian losses.

I have a friend in kyiv and i asked him if he could help me out with something that was made in ukraine by ukrainians.

I wanted the coat of arms on a t-shirt and also the first lines of the ;825 :0G0 ?> ""8A8=V.

The coat of arms I had to ask my friend about if i as a fat nonfighting foreginer would bring any dishounor to wearing it.

And the song resonates dearly with me after seeing the maidan struggle where the song was played.

When I asked my friend for the price he payed for the tshirt so i could reimburse him all he said was.

""how would u feel about donating""

I didnt hesitate a single second and donated to his choosen organization ""comebackalive""

This is the endresult of the t shirt and me prodly wearing it!

I want u all to know that Ukraine inspires me every day to be a better person!

I have never been more embarrassed to say that in my life. That being said, after seeing what happened yesterday, I have never been more disgusted with this country. Americans that are like-minded in the movement against our own government were having an economic blackout day yesterday to try and hurt our economy. But today, I suggest it is a day that we flood the Ukrainian government with our donations to stand together to let them know that we choose to stand with Ukraine in solidarity.

What the American president is doing right now is not only disgusting but it is illegal. But apparently laws do not matter anymore. He has declared himself king and has already said that only he and his attorney general are to interpret the law. During his first term, the reason why he was impeached was for withholding Funds from Ukraine that it already been appropriated by Congress. He is threatening to do the same now.

So I am asking, no begging the world to show Ukraine that we care !!

I have been up all night wondering what we can do as average people and all I could come up with was trying to use the momentum now to raise money for the Ukraine directly from all those Americans that want (part of) their tax money to go to Ukraine. I feel like it would send a strong message and maybe make an actual difference if enough Americans donated to show solidarity. Is this a silly idea? 

I have a marketing background and would dedicate 2-4 hours a week to campaigning for this online. It feels like something I can realistically do. I would promote giving to https://u24.gov.ua/ because it seems the most direct and obviously trustworthy (nothing is obviously trustworthy any more, of course) way to support the Ukraine. Thoughts?

"2025-02-28",1740774013,"If you're here to rage donate but low on money, remember that airline miles, hotel points, credit card points, and Amazon/other store gift cards can also make an impact. These help volunteers headed to help Ukraine or come home after long service or injury and can help get needed supplies.","I see a lot of lovely people donating right now which is amazing. Not everyone has money however and also some people may not know that these options exist. Here is what you can do:

1. Airline miles. If you have any kind of miles, sign up [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB7UfqhrlSgq_mXr73Y9m4NHvE6pZbwVbF3_c8e4lrisAV7g/viewform) You can help a volunteer getting to Ukraine to help or coming home. Volunteers on their way to Ukraine are either military veterans of their home country or usually served previously in Ukraine. On their way home they are coming home due to injury or at least 6 months of service. All miles programs can be helpful. We have an expert who will help you make the booking. Last year 70 people helping Ukraine got flight costs covered this way.
2. Hotel points. When Protect a Volunteer is booking tickets for injured soldiers to go home they often need a hotel. You can use hotel points to cover this. All programs are helpful but Hilton and Marriott are especially good as they are close to the Warsaw and Krakow airports and accessible for disabled people. Sign up at the same form as above. Many people have lots of hotel points from business travel that they don't need and we have people who could use them.
3. If you have any kind of credit card points, these also can help. Some of them can be turned in for credit at [dell.com](http://dell.com) or other tech sites to buy computers for drone operators. Others can be turned into travel benefits. Really there are all kinds of things that can be done depending on the program you have. Sign up at the same link and just tell us what points you have.
4. Amazon Gift Cards. If you got an Amazon gift card for your birthday or Christmas, you can use these to help! Some basic medical supplies are always available on Amazon. We created a wishlist here that you can use: [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/ZWO1773I29EU](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/ZWO1773I29EU)
5. Other gift cards. If you ended up with another gift card that you're not using, you can let us know what it is and chances are there are some kind of supplies that could be helpful with it. Definitely do this by making a comment below. Might require some community brainstorming for some of thing to think about what is available!

= Had the utilities turned back on in Svetlana's apartment.

= Covered the first 2mo of Svetlana's chemo + meds.

Hello! You're wonderful. Thank you for caring enough to act.

Governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs/nonprofits), and volunteers are all critical components of Ukraine's defense. There are hundreds of initiatives to choose from. Some are legitimate. Some, sadly, are grifters. Happens in every war.

We maintain a list of NGOs and volunteers we know to be trustworthy and doing good work. We focus on excellent, effective smaller organizations and volunteers who don't have the exposure and networks available to big orgs like United24, Come Back Alive, and Prytula. You can find the list here:

Trump keeps throwing around the number **$350 billion** when talking about U.S. aid to Ukraine, but thats just NOT TRUE.

According to an official statement from the **State Department**, as of **January 20th, 2025**, the U.S. has provided:

* **$65.9 billion** in military aid since Russias full-scale invasion in 2022.
* **$69.2 billion** in total military aid since Russias **initial** invasion in 2014.
* **$27.7 billion** of that aid came from **Presidential Drawdown Authority**, meaning equipment sent from DoD stockpiles.

Where the hell is this **$350 billion** number coming from? Why does my stupid cheeto puff dumb president keep spreading this BS number around????

I'm a United States Marine Corps Veteran and am so ashamed of my dumbass president. What is happening to my country? I'm so sorry to my Ukrainian allies. I deployed overseas to support NATO in 2022 and am deeply fond of the Ukrainian's aims in winning against Russia. I'm losing my mind.

Needless to say we expect things to get a lot more kinetic in the coming days so the fundraiser is urgent.

Its a camp in one of the EU countries by the sea. Theres a program developed for kids and their moms with lots of activities - neurographics - at least 4 times, drawing workshops, art therapy, dying T-shirts, or something that the children bring with them - acrylic painting on cloth. Every day there are conversations that help mothers and children deal with trauma, yoga, meditations, massages, individual work, sea visits are a must. Sightseeing, a hike to the churches and the castle. The camp has two swimming pools, the staff is Ukrainian, the cuisine is delicious, and there is also a morning walk, a walk at sea with music at 10:00. In general, after the trip, there are huge changes in kids everyday mood and perception.

Our goal is $5500. Funds raised so far: $575

Three years ago, on February 24, 2022, the nightmare began.

Ihor Zakharenko: Before Bucha, there was the Zhytomyr Highway. This video has no captions or musicso that media outlets across the world can show the atrocities committed by the Russians and never forget them.

We drive along the Zhytomyr Highway and witness what was left behind: bodies of people, shot and abandoned. Cars burned out, the lives inside them extinguished. A horrific tragedy unfolded here, captured by my friends from the Bugatti group with a drone.

A convoy of civilians tried to flee. The Russians opened fire.

A white car with a punctured tire. Inside was a mother with her child. She locked her child in, trying to protect thembut she died on the spot.

A manour friend, an employee of a travel companyleapt out of his car, raised his hands, pleading for mercy. But there was no mercy. A gunshot. He fell.

A Russian soldier, emerging from a tank, ran toward the car. He wasnt alone. They dragged a woman and her child from the vehicle and took them into the forest.

The man was left behind. His body was dragged off the road, his pockets searched.

We sent our drone further. We searched for where the woman and her child had been taken. We found the Russian positions. And then&

Debris. Trash. Condoms, a pile of them.

And then we saw them.

Bodies. Piled up. Burned.

Many bodies of women.

It is unbearable to think about what the Russians did to them.

Before Bucha, there was the Zhytomyr Highway. And the world must never forget.

We are still fighting all support welcome:

# Agreement lacks explicit security guarantees for Kyiv

By Jane Lytvynenko and [Ian Lovett](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ian-lovett) and Nikita Nikolaienko 

Updated Feb. 26, 2025 at 1:03 pm ET

https://preview.redd.it/dt1lvcen4jle1.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e86ba680c4730ed6601b7025b329dcc190c8d7e5

KYIV, UkraineKyiv and Washington have reached a deal over Ukraines mineral resources, but many details remain to be worked out before any money starts flowing. 

The text of the deal, which doesnt include explicit security guarantees for Ukraine, envisions the creation of a fund co-owned by the two countries, with the details of the financial arrangement to be determined later. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously had said security guarantees would be necessary for any mineral-rights deal. One clause of the agreement, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, says that the U.S. supports Ukraines efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.

This deal is part of our broader arrangements with the United States, Zelensky said. This deal can be part of future security guarantees.

President Trump said Wednesday that Zelensky would be coming Friday to Washington to sign a deal. Im not going to make security guarantees, Trump said during a Cabinet meeting, noting Europeans would place troops in Ukraine, but were going to make sure everything goes well.

Weve been able to make a deal where were going to get our money back, and were going to get a lot more money in the future, and I think thats appropriate because we have taxpayers footing the bill, Trump said.

Zelensky said earlier he had been invited to the U.S. to meet with Trump this week, but he wasnt sure if he would go and that details of the visit were still being worked out. 

This visit before \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin is a very good signal, he said. 

He emphasized that the future of [the mineral-rights](https://www.wsj.com/world/a-look-at-the-ukrainian-minerals-that-trump-wants-54edb78a?mod=article_inline) deal would depend on his broader conversations with Trump and his commitment to helping Ukraine. This agreement can have a major success or quietly pass by, Zelensky said. And I believe that a major success depends on our conversation with President Trump. 

He said he would have several questions for Trump whenever they meet, including whether the U.S. would cut off aid to Ukraine, and if so, whether Ukraine would be able to buy weapons from the U.S. He also would ask whether sanctions on Russia would be lifted, he said. We will draw conclusions after my dialogue with President Trump, Zelensky said.

https://preview.redd.it/deajpe5s4jle1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc96c1a555c08e62bf304ca11c1b3e33dac51924

Trump said Wednesday that he was focused on establishing peace in the region, but didnt say what that meant for the future of Ukraines government or borders. Were going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people, he said. The U.S. and Russia have agreed to appoint teams to [hold talks](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-seeks-to-reset-tense-ties-with-russia-1b4f3d35?mod=article_inline)on a settlement to end the war. 

Putin will have to make concessions as part of a peace deal, Trump said without offering specifics. He later said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was out of the question, an apparent reference to Ukraines hoped-for accession to the alliance, a move Trump opposes. The president further said he would like Ukraine to get back as much of its territory as possible.

The mineral-rights agreement has been a sticking point in the relationship between Kyiv and Washington, which has deteriorated rapidly this month. Zelensky refused to sign a version of the deal presented to him this month by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  

At the time, he said he couldnt sign an agreement that didnt include security guarantees for Ukraine. Officials across Europe also expressed shock at some of the demands the U.S. had made in the offer, including the right to up to $500 billion in revenue from mineral development, which is far more than the U.S. has contributed to Ukraine since Russias invasion began.

After Zelensky refused the initial offer, [Trump called him a dictator](https://www.wsj.com/world/zelensky-says-trump-needs-more-truth-after-claims-ukraine-started-the-war-08989b98?mod=article_inline) and falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war. Top U.S. officials earlier this month met with their Russian counterparts to discuss how to end the conflict, without Ukraine, and the U.S. voted against a United Nations resolution blaming Russia for the war in Ukraine.

Zelensky said the current agreement was an improvement on the original because it didnt ask Ukraine to pay back aid that the U.S. had already sent. The exact economic arrangement of the co-owned fund will need to be determined in future agreements, Zelensky said. A portion of the proceeds from the fund would be put toward reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, according to the text.

Between the first step and the second step, we need to understand where we stand with the United States of America, Zelensky said.

Oil and natural gas, as well as critical minerals, are included in the terms of the agreement, but any resources that already are earning money for the Ukrainian government are excluded.

He added that if Kyiv needed to repay future aid, he was prepared to agree to that, because we will need that help.

Security guaranteesto ensure that Russia cant simply rebuild its arsenal and then invade againremain the top Ukrainian priority for any cease-fire agreement. 

Zelensky has long listed NATO membership as his goal but has also signaled that he would be open to other security arrangements.  

On Wednesday, Zelensky said that the mineral-rights framework agreement does include a mention of security guarantees for Ukraine, though he didnt provide further details.

Since Trump began his broadsides against Zelensky this month, European countries have started planning for how they could support Ukraine if the U.S. were to cut aid. Zelensky said eight northern European and Baltic countries are now discussing sending military contingents to help guarantee Ukraines security during a cease-fire.

Zelensky repeatedly expressed his hope that the U. S.which has been the largest donor to Ukraine since the start of Russias full-scale invasionwould be part of guaranteeing Ukraines security in any deal to end the conflict.

Today its important not to lose the U.S. as one of the guarantorswhether its the main guarantor or one of the guarantorsof security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky said. And we are working on it.

LONDONPresident Trumps [diplomatic embrace](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-putin-us-russia-economic-deal-679a9d26?mod=article_inline) of Russia and threats to [cut off military aid](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/without-u-s-aid-ukraine-would-lose-some-of-its-most-sophisticated-weapons-e3bf6cb7?mod=article_inline) to Ukraine has caused alarm among European allies that the U.S. may no longer be willing to [come to the continents defense](https://www.wsj.com/world/trump-zelensky-foreign-policy-world-alliances-a3592bc4?mod=article_inline). 

But it also seems to be making progress toward a longstanding U.S. goal: jolting Europeans into spending more on their own defense. 

On Tuesday, the British government announced the biggest increase in military spending since the Cold War. In Germany, the incoming government is [considering ways](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/why-germanys-confidence-is-shattered-and-its-economy-is-kaput-d1d95890?mod=article_inline) to ease a constitutional rule limiting debt to fund a significant increase in military power. Denmark last week said it would ratchet up its investment in the military, with its prime minister urging her Danish defense chief to buy, buy, buy.

In a speech to parliament, U.K. Prime Minister [Keir Starmer](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/keir-starmer) vowed to accelerate plans to raise military spending from a current 2.3% of gross domestic product to 2.5% of annual economic output from 2027three years faster than previously planned. He also announced additional spending on intelligence services. To fund the increase, he said the U.K. would nearly halve its expenditure on overseas development aid. 

For peace to endure in Ukraine and beyond, we need deterrence. Peace through strength, Starmer told lawmakers. He said the U.K. would ultimately raise military spending to 3% of GDP[close to U.S. levels](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/debt-has-always-been-the-ruinof-great-powers-is-the-u-s-next-02f16402?mod=article_inline)by around 2030.  

https://preview.redd.it/fgnt0jsukble1.png?width=1288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c642deb35049dd0b876a8c135523c6a81be699

The pledge comes as Starmer prepares to visit Trump this week to urge him to include Ukraine in [peace negotiations with Russia](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-putin-us-russia-economic-deal-679a9d26?mod=article_inline) and to provide security guarantees to consolidate any eventual cease-fire. What is needed more than anything is a lasting peace, he said. All European allies must step up, he said.

Europes governments began to reverse decades of military spending cuts in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, and gave budgets another small nudge after Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The European Unions total defense expenditure rose by more than 30% between 2021 and 2024 to 326 billion eurosequivalent to approximately $341 billionabout 1.9% of the EUs economic output, according to the European Defense Agency. 

But progress has been [slow and patchy](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/alarm-nato-weak-military-empty-arsenals-europe-a72b23f4?mod=article_inline)apart from countries such as Poland and the Baltics that are Russias neighbors. Many European politicians have been wary of cutting social-welfare spending in favor of defense for fear of angering voters. 

Trumps statements implying that the defense of Europe is no longer Americas priority may have panicked North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies into opening their wallets, said Bence Nemeth, a defense professor at Kings College London. Every U.S. president has pressured the Europeans on defense since Truman, Nemeth said. The policy didnt change, the style has changed. 

https://preview.redd.it/5kdxy3zxkble1.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cc5a4fc1bcdea1e8bcaa06aed0bd612a4b387d5

Trumps attempts to mediate a quick end to the war in Ukraine has caused particular consternation, with some European leaders fearing it will leave Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin) emboldened and better able to disrupt smaller Eastern European nations who dont have large militaries. 

[Germanys next leader](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/german-voters-take-first-step-toward-filling-europes-leadership-vacuum-6add2f58?mod=article_inline), Friedrich Merz, who is poised to become chancellor after Sundays election, has said that the U.S. had become indifferent to the fate of Europe and should prepare to defend itself alone.

I never expected Id think this, let alone say it, but the signals we are receiving indicate that (the U.S.) interest in Europe is fading. I hope we can still persuade the Americans that it is in all our interests to maintain good trans-Atlantic relations, but we must prepare for the worst, he said.

The sense of abandonment by the U.S. has been palpable in Berlin over the past few weeks. Germany didnt develop its own nuclear deterrent on the understanding that it would be covered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. 

Post-War Western Germany, its institutions, constitution, its culture and economy, were largely shaped by the U.S., which maintains its second-largest overseas military presence in the country. Some 40 million Americans, including Trump, claim German ancestry.

There remains a divide in Europe between those on its eastern flank who feel directly threatened by Russia and those in the West who dont. Poland and the Nordic countries have already [increased their military spending](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europe-is-boosting-military-spending-its-still-not-enough-020b432a?mod=article_inline). However countries such as Spain and Italy lag behind. 

Much [depends on France and Germany](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-putin-us-russia-economic-deal-679a9d26?mod=article_inline). French President Emmanuel Macronrecently said he planned to increase military spending, without specifying a target.

Even if both nations increase spending, it could take years to get Europes militaries up to fighting shape. Europes defense industry is still reheating after years of under investment. Around 80% of European defense procurement comes from suppliers outside the EU, according to the Kiel Institute, a German research group. 

Russia is producing in three months in ammunition what the whole of the alliance is producing in the year, and this is simply not sustainable. We have to ramp up the defense industry production, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said earlier this month. 

The U.K. is historically Europes biggest defense spender. But its own armed forces have been hollowed out by years of underinvestment and the handling of billions of dollars of equipment to Ukraine. Much of its defense budget is sucked into maintaining its nuclear deterrent. Even the significant increase, may not be enough to fully fix the military, military officials have warned. Some say the target needs to be 3.5% of GDP to get the armed forces back into shape.

Trumps treatment of Zelensky in the Oval Office should spur European leaders into action. Can anyone be confident that they will do so?

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskys Oval Office meeting descended into chaos. After Zelensky presented president Donald Trump with boxer Oleksandr Usyks world title belt and extolled US-Ukraine economic cooperation, the discussion turned to potential negotiations with Russia. It triggered a firestorm. Vice-president JD Vance assailed Zelensky for his supposed ingratitude for US military assistance and Trump accused Ukraine of gambling with World War Three.  

Although Zelensky subsequently attempted to cool tensions by expressing his thanks for US support on X, the rift with Trump continued to widen over the afternoon. In a fiery Truth Social post, Trump declared I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace and doubled down on his claims that the Ukrainian president disrespected the US in the Oval Office. South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Ukraines most ardent supporters in Trumps orbit, urged Zelensky to resign. 

It will have come as some comfort to Zelensky that many European leaders have rallied behind him. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk wrote on X Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, Dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone. Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French president Emmanuel Macron broke with Trump by correctly stating that Russia is the aggressor in the Ukraine War. 

But as the chasm between the US and Europe widens further, Ukraines near-term future is bleak. The rare earth mineral deal was not signed as expected and now may never be. While Trump has described the proposed agreement as a multibillion-dollar deal that would compensate the US for aiding Ukraine, the path to converting critical minerals into hard currency was always going to be fraught with complications, even before the Oval Office shouting match.  

Unless fences between Kyiv and Washington are mended swiftly, US military assistance to Ukraine could soon grind to a halt. Earlier this month, arms shipments to Ukraine that were authorised by president Joe Biden were briefly curtailed. It triggered panic in Kyiv and Europe. While Ukraine still has enough weapons to fight until the summer, a loss of American assistance could force it to surrender its diplomatically valuable foothold in Kursk and redirect scarce supplies to protecting its own territory. 

With the Trump administration evidently willing to reset relations with Russia and not viewing European security as a core US national interest, the key question is whether Europe will step up. Germany is leading the charge, rhetorically at least. Merz recently declared: My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA. Not to be outdone by Germany, Macron is understood to be interested in creating a French nuclear umbrella over Europe. 

But is Europe willing to put its money where its mouth is? British Prime Minister Keir Starmer made a tepid step in the right direction by announcing that he would increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027, but nobody believes that will make much of a difference. In Germany, Merz has reportedly approached the Social Democratic Party about devising a 200-billion-euro special defence spending package. However, his refusal to lift the debt brake implies significant spending cuts elsewhere that might be politically impossible to achieve.

Trumps Oval Office meeting with Zelensky should be the moment that finally sharpens minds in Europe. This may well be its greatest test in decades. It is disturbing indeed that nobody can have much confidence that European leaders are capable of meeting the moment.

"2025-03-01",1740839436,"RU POV: Discussion on Trump &amp; Zelenskyy negotiations","So much of the narrative seems to be changing so rapidly with the recent events of Trumps phone call with Putin, negotians to proceed between US &amp; Russia without Ukraine and the absolute fiasco with Trump &amp; Zelenskyy at the white house.

But I honestly believe that was theatrics for the masses. Zelenskyy is well aware of the fact that the US will completely abandon Ukraine as the west has realised it's un-winnable war and its time to plug the drain. We have to remember that Zelenskyy himself is an actor. He was set up by the west to do the bidding of the Western elite.

I believe that Trump demanding 500 Billion worth of Ukrainian minerals was deliberately set up to be ""declined"" by Zelenskyy so that now Trump can say that we tried to recoup our money in Ukraine and they are refusing so we will stop all support and Zelenskyy can say how he defiantly stood up to Trump and turned down the deal for the sake of his people and that way both parties save face to their respective audiences.

The West knows that there's a real chance of Black Swan event where Zelenskyy could be murdered and a possible complete overthrow of his government could happen by extremists such as Azov and that would create absolute instability in the whole region.

So now the west will negotiate with Russia on concessions of land, no NATO membership etc and to try and save face while simultaneously keeping their post maiden 2014 government in place without the risk of complete instability and revolution in the region.

They might even force elections in Ukraine so Zelenskyy can step down without getting the Mussolini treatment and the west can install its next actor while keeping the current pro-US administration intact.

The only other thing I could think of would be that Zelenskyy will go to Europe and demand to make a new alliance. A NATO 2.0 so to speak with the same benefits as NATO without the US (temporarily) and then once Trump leaves the white house in 4yrs. The next administrative will say well it's in our best interest to be in this alliance while in the mean time the west has made a ceasefire with Russia, frozen the conflict, promised no NATO membership while simultaneously creating a new alliance with Ukraine apart of it which the US will be apart of post trump allowing Ukraine to arm itself over the next few years and then go at it again hoping this time they will defeat Russia.

This was a public punishment beating for Zelensky - they must have run out of champagne in the Kremlin: PATRICK BISHOP

Last night we watched the death of decency in American politics live on our television screens.

It was meant to be a possibly historic meeting between two presidents  one weak, one all-powerful  with the potential to hasten the end of a bloody war that has bent global politics out of shape and whose outcome will effect all our futures.

Instead, it looked like a showdown between a thuggish Mafia boss and his fawning henchman and a recalcitrant shopkeeper who wasn't coming up with the protection money.

The smiling Trump we saw on Thursday charming Britain's Prime Minister, and opening a window on a glowing future of Anglo-American co-operation and prosperity, was a different human being to the Trump we witnessed last night.

Dr Jekyll gave way to Mr Hyde and the man before us was an ugly sight. He hectored, he insulted, he intimidated. Beside him sat his enforcer JD Vance, eagerly piling on the psychological pressure. At any moment you expected him to say: 'Shall I do him now, boss?'

In keeping with the code of the Mob, one of Volodymyr Zelensky's cardinal offences was that he had apparently shown insufficient 'respect'.

'What you are doing is disrespectful to the country  this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have,' barked Trump.

Zelensky calmly interjected: 'I'm with all respect for your country.'

Vice-President Vance interrupted: 'Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?'

Zelensky replied: 'A lot of times.'

Vance sneered back: 'No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you?' Then he demanded that Zelensky 'offer some words of appreciation for the USA and the president who is trying to save your country'  like a Victorian schoolmaster asking a pupil to thank him for the thrashing he had just administered.

Zelensky endured the pile-on with his customary dignity. English is far from his first language, yet his responses to their verbal violence was restrained, almost sorrowful. His performance will only enhance his standing with the millions in the decent world who regard him as a hero and the quintessence of everything that Trump and Vance are not.

As ever in this story their discourse was steeped in mendacity. Trump and Vance have relentlessly promoted the malign fantasy that Ukraine provoked the terrible fate it is now suffering. In their insane inversion of the truth, Zelensky is a dictator and a thief intent on continuing the war for his own obscure purposes.

At one point in his tirade, finger jabbing menacingly, Trump accused Zelensky of 'gambling with World War Three,' oblivious apparently of the constant threats from Moscow promising nuclear armageddon on Europe and the US if it stepped up support for Kyiv.

They must have run out of champagne in the Kremlin. Putin's masterful handling of his dupe in the White House has surely succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.

What more could Trump possibly give him  unless it is an offer to use tens of thousands of US troops in Europe to attack Ukraine from the rear?

I exaggerate. But we are learning that it is unwise to believe there are any limits to what Trump will or will not do. And it looks as if he is preparing for a punishment for Zelensky and his people the effects of which could have profound consequences for all of us. 'Your country is in big trouble,' he shouted at Zelensky.

And so it will be if Zelensky does not conform utterly and uncomplainingly to whatever lies next in Trump's Ukraine 'strategy' plans. It is now clear that Ukraine's and Zelensky's wishes will count for nothing. What was billed as a move to take account of Kyiv's concerns and involve it, albeit tangentially, in the diplomacy turned out to be a public punishment beating, delivered on the global stage.

Was it a deliberate set-up, or did things just get out hand? Either way the omens suggest disaster for Ukraine.

Without American military support Ukraine can stagger on for a few months. But that will be it. Europe is in no position to fill the vast chasm that will be left in the Ukrainian inventory were Trump to turn off the taps.

Without Patriot missiles, Ukraine's cities will be naked and defenceless against Russian missile and drone attacks. Starved of ATACMS missiles the army will be powerless to strike behind the enemy lines and be reduced to a slow death by a thousand cuts in the trenches.

Zelensky is now caught in a vice, with both Trump and Putin tightening the handle.

Even submission may now not be enough. As we saw last night, Trump's anger against him is so visceral that he may well demand his head as the price for continuing his negotiations.

Submission would mean that all Ukraine's sacrifices in blood and treasure have been in vain.

Even if some sort of peace is established, its fate henceforth will be as a joint vassal state shared by a rapacious Russia and an unscrupulous US.

They will not be only losers. Europe's weakness has been shockingly exposed, and Putin will be looking for new conquests once he has digested Ukraine.

Last night's performance, with its total contempt for the norms of decency that most of us find essential in leading our daily lives, should at least have blown away any illusions that in Donald Trump we are dealing with someone who can be handled. This man is dangerous: For Ukraine, for us and for America. The only people who can sleep easy in their beds tonight are the Russians.

Published March 1, 2025
Updated March 2, 2025, 10:11 a.m. ET

Brighton Beach, a Slavic enclave in Brooklyn where Ukrainians outnumber Russians two to one, voted overwhelmingly for President Trump.

But the day after Mr. Trump dressed down President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in an explosive meeting at the White House  the latest show of Mr. Trumps declining support for Ukraine  some Ukrainian New Yorkers were left feeling divided.

His approach may come across a bit too aggressive, Igor Moshchinsky, 61, said of Mr. Trump at a cafe on Brighton Beach Avenue on Saturday afternoon. But Mr. Moshchinsky, who voted for Mr. Trump, said I dont disagree with the content of Mr. Trumps criticisms of Mr. Zelensky.

The local city councilwoman, Inna Vernikov, a Republican and a Trump supporter, tried to thread a needle, writing on social media that the consequences of Fridays meeting could be disastrous for both countries.

Working together to end this war and help the people of Ukraine restore their safety and sovereignty is in the best interests of both of our countries and the world, she said.

Inna Kir, 58, who owns a lingerie shop on Brighton Beach Avenue, said she absolutely agrees with the tough line Mr. Trump has taken against Mr. Zelensky. She echoed Mr. Trumps criticism that Mr. Zelensky was insufficiently grateful for American aid.

I think he should appreciate what people do for him, said Ms. Kir, a United States citizen who arrived three decades ago. Its our money.

She added: I have faith in Trumps ability to bring peace. When the money is not going to flow, the war is going to be over very soon.

Igor Kozak, 59, who is from western Ukraine, and his wife, Marina Kozak, 57, who is Russian, agreed that Mr. Zelensky had been rude and disrespectful.

Not all Ukrainian New Yorkers  there are about 150,000 of them  support Mr. Trump, of course.

And in another Ukrainian pocket in the East Village of Manhattan, critics of Mr. Trump were aghast at his attack.

Ive never been so disgusted with the president of this country, said Ivan Makar, 52, the principal of the Self-Reliance Saturday School of Ukrainian Studies on East Sixth Street. Mr. Makar, who lives in Westchester County north of the city, said his family had fled Ukraine seeking security. The meeting on Friday left him furious and devastated, he said.

It was typical bully behavior, and Zelensky stood up to the bullies, Mr. Makar said. As a Ukrainian, Im proud. As an American, Im disgusted.

Jason Birchard, 58, the owner of the Ukrainian restaurant Veselka in the East Village, stood inside the restaurant on Saturday wearing a T-shirt embossed with the tryzub, Ukraines national symbol.

Ive worn this shirt many times over the last three years, and I made sure to dig deep into the closet today and pull it out because I really want to back Zelensky, Mr. Birchard said, as a line streamed around the block.

Mr. Birchard said the restaurant had seen a surge in customers amid the news.
By
Im a Ukrainian American, and I try to stay positive and optimistic, he said. There is the false narrative that Ukraine invaded Russia. We have to understand that Ukraine has been an independent democratic state for more than 30 years, and that we need to draw the line here.

In Brooklyn, on a sunny corner off Brighton Beach Avenue, Ilia Makarov, 20, vented similar frustrations as the Q train clattered overhead.

Mr. Makarov, a computer science student who came to Brighton Beach from Ukraine five years ago, said he found it unimaginable that the United States might now back Russia in the war.

Usually when you think about the U.S. it is as peacemakers, Mr. Makarov said. Now they support literally the terrorists.

Volodymyr Zelensky fought for Ukraines security guarantees so fiercely last night, it was as if hed been invited to sign a surrender to Russia, not a mineral deal with the US. It was neither the time nor the place to take on Donald Trump and JD Vance for parroting Kremlin talking points  a fact Zelensky seemed to acknowledge later on Fox News. Looking visibly distressed, he admitted such matters should be handled behind closed doors. There was regret, but no apology to Trumps camp. I respect President Trump and the American people, but Im not sure weve done something bad. We must be open and honest, Zelensky said.

The meeting in the Oval Office turned into disaster because Zelensky couldnt bite his tongue when he should have, and because he and Trump have fundamentally different visions for how Russias war in Ukraine should end. Zelensky insists on receiving security guarantees to achieve lasting peace, while Trump backs quick ceasefire with security discussed afterwards. The American president was so irritated by the topic that, when asked by a reporter last night what would happen if Russia broke the ceasefire, Trump scoffed: What if a bomb drops on your head right now?. 

Trump doesnt want to have any obligations in Ukraine and insists that Putin can be trusted not to break the ceasefire because Trump is in office. But Ukraines security guarantees cannot depend on another countrys temporary administration. Trumps ignorance of this fact  and of Ukrainians needs to ensure the war never happens again  makes the quick peace he dreams of even harder to achieve. This is what Zelensky tried to explain in his third language last night before Trump and Vance took it personally and accused the Ukrainian president of disrespecting them and not being grateful enough. 

For the past two weeks, the Trumps administration has used blackmail, intimidation and provocation to force Zelensky into a deal that, in its original form, would have saddled Ukraine with $500 billion in debt to the US. Zelensky fought for a better version of the draft  one he still saw as a concession in exchange for a first step to security  before traveling from a war-torn country to the US to sign it. Zelensky may have been better off ignoring Vances jabs and focusing solely on speaking with Trump, but that doesnt change the reality: Trump either genuinely lives in Russias disinformation bubble or is clearly on Russias side. 

Trumps rhetoric  calling Zelensky a dictator, blaming Ukraine for starting a war, demanding wartime elections to install a more obedient leader, twisting facts and making up numbers about the aid  was seen by Zelensky as a direct attack on him and his country. He entered the Oval Office ready to defend. Did Zelensky overplay his hand? Yes. But when Trump blamed him for having too much hatred towards Putin, a man responsible for at least 55,000 Ukrainian deaths in three years, Zelensky knew that staying silent would mean he would have to seek forgiveness later at home. 

Whether it was worth the cost is another question. Reports suggest Trump is already considering halting all military aid to Ukraine. Without Patriot air defense missiles, Ukrainian cities will once again be exposed, and it will take Europe months to replace American arms. In response, Ukrainians began raising donations to build nuclear weapons, collecting £400,000 within hours. Of course, the money will ultimately go toward drones, but their message was clear. Last night, they felt disrespected and betrayed by the Trump administration.

# Ukraines supporters saw Steve Witkoffs comments as an embrace of a Kremlin talking point

By [Yaroslav Trofimov](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/yaroslav-trofimov) and [Michael R. Gordon](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/michael-r-gordon)

Feb. 27, 2025 at 12:15 pm ET

https://preview.redd.it/d4h0ov2tzple1.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581a052dcfaa56dd730608ef3e31eb41948f4baf

A suggestion by the Trump administrations top negotiator that [a Ukraine peace deal](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-peace-talks-guides-e9a3b6cf?mod=article_inline) would be based on talks conducted in Istanbul nearly three years ago has buoyed Russian officials and spooked Ukraine and its backers.

To Kyiv, recent remarks by Steve Witkoff appeared to embrace the Kremlins key, and incorrect, talking point over the past three years: that Ukraine and Russia were about to strike a peace deal in Istanbul, and that Kyiv walked away from an agreement under pressure from Western politicians, such as then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin) has repeatedly demanded that any future peace talks be based on a return to [the Istanbul parameters](https://www.wsj.com/world/did-ukraine-miss-an-early-chance-to-negotiate-peace-with-russia-d864b7c9?mod=article_inline), which in Moscows interpretation foresee a sharp cut in Ukraines military, a ban on foreign weapons and troops, and a Russian veto on Western security assistance in case of renewed conflict. Ukraine refuses to return to that draft, which was never completed or approved by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

We came very very close to signing something, and I think we will be using that framework as a guidepost to get a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia, and I think that this will be an amazing day, Witkoff said in a CNN appearance Sunday about the Istanbul talks, which were held in late March 2022.

Witkoffs comments werent intended to be an endorsement of the Russian view that Ukraine should be largely demilitarized or that Russia should have a veto over foreign military support for Kyiv or security assurances for Ukraine, according to a person familiar with his thinking. His view is that the two parties were close to a deal in Istanbul and that the Trump administration didnt need to reinvent the wheel, the person said. The U.S. approach should be to take the framework from that 2022 negotiating effort and adapt them to the current circumstances, including by reflecting the changed situation on the battlefield, the person said.

Witkoff also didnt intend his comments to be an endorsement of capping the Ukrainian military at a low level of troops, the person said. In fact, the U.S. believes that Ukraine needs security safeguards, the person said, adding that the Trump administration and its interlocutors would have conversations about what that means and which nations could provide them. 

https://preview.redd.it/iecux78xzple1.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0679c4d38e47000a37a955c0bb81dce462773ab

The White Houses National Security Council didnt reply to questions about what Witkoff meant by a return to the Istanbul framework.

The comments from Witkoff came ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Zelensky over a deal to give [the U.S. rights to the countrys mineral resources](https://www.wsj.com/world/zelensky-says-details-of-u-s-deal-for-resources-still-need-to-be-worked-out-aa763dab?mod=article_inline). On Thursday, British Prime Minister [Keir Starmer](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/keir-starmer) was expected to press Trump over [a U.S. backstop](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/starmer-to-raise-u-s-military-role-for-ukraine-peacekeepers-with-trump-de4c816e?mod=article_inline) London is seeking to help European troops maintain the peace if an agreement to end the war were eventually reached.

The Istanbul talks were convened as Russian tanks were on the Kyiv ring road, a culmination of negotiations that began shortly after the Feb. 24, 2022, Russian invasion. They reflected the battlefield situation when Ukraines statehood was on the verge of collapse, and Russia was dictating terms for a surrender.

Russian troops, however, were defeated around Kyiv and the rest of northern Ukraine just as negotiators gathered in the Turkish city, and Ukraine has since then reclaimed additional areas of Kharkiv and Kherson regions. No documents were signed in Istanbul, and the two sides were wide apart on key issues.

Zelensky ordered an end to these talks once Ukrainian troops found hundreds of executed civilians in the town of Bucha near Kyiv following the Russian retreat. He has since demanded a full Russian withdrawal from occupied regions of Ukraine and a prosecution of Russian war crimes. Last December, he described the Istanbul drafts as a Russian ultimatum.

From Ukraines standpoint, Istanbul terms mean a capitulation and an end to our state, said Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a government think tank in Kyiv. If the Trump administration cuts off aid, the situation will be difficult but not catastrophic. But if we agree to disarm, this will be the end of us, and we are not idiots and wont make the same mistake again.

https://preview.redd.it/clf2o4m00qle1.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a0490e54bffd1e0115d6135f1a0a7248302d677

The resurrection of the Istanbul process by the Trump administration, Ukrainian officials and their allies say, could give Putin a political victory in Ukraine even though he hasnt actually been able to achieve his war aims on the battlefield.

While Russian troops have been on the offensive since the summer of 2023, losing hundreds of thousands of soldiers by Western estimates, they have failed to make major advances or seize large population centers. The areas of Ukraine under Russian occupation have increased from just under 18% to just over 18% in that year and a half, while Ukraine gained control of a sliver of Russias Kursk region.

The negotiating teams in Istanbul didnt have the authority to make binding decisions, and there were still wide divergences between Russian and Ukrainian positions on key issues at the time the process ended.

One major area of disagreement was the cap imposed on the size of the Ukrainian military, with Russia demanding a limit of 85,000 troops and Kyiv insisting on 250,000. Another disagreement was on the kind and quantity of weapons that Kyiv would be able to keep. Ukraine currently has nearly a million armed men and women defending the country, and an arsenal of sophisticated weaponry provided by the West, including F-16 aircraft and missiles that can strike deep into Russia.

Another area of disagreement was the Russian demand that any security guarantees provided to Ukraine be subject to a veto by Moscowrendering them meaningless. Russia also demanded making Russian an official language in Ukraine and wide-ranging legislative changes to officially promote its vision of Ukrainian and Soviet history. 

From Kyivs standpoint today, agreeing to any limits on the size of its armed forces and on the kinds of weapons that its military operates would be suicidal. 

Accepting such terms is just an invitation for another war, but a much more dramatic one because next time Russia wont repeat the same mistakes again, said former Defense Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, who still advises the government.

https://preview.redd.it/23yy1qq30qle1.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d3ce07a947363474fef0a39b38dcad6e2b4383

Even after hostilities end, Ukraine will maintain armed forces at the maximal size that is required to deter another Russian invasion, Zelensky said as he prepared to meet Trump on Friday. I believe in our army, and it will be one of our most important security guarantees, he said.

It is unclear whether the Trump administration has a detailed strategy for how to end the war that began with Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Witkoff has talked about building on the Istanbul framework, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in an interview with Fox News, suggested that Ukraine needed to maintain strength in any peace deal. 

What Ukraine needs really is a deterrent, he said. They need to make it costly for anyone to come after them again in the future.

According to European officials, Britain and France are looking for a U.S. backstop that would entail some degree of military support for a European force of some 30,000 troops that would police a future cease-fire in Ukraine. 

The U.S. wouldnt be asked to put troops on the ground in Ukraine and this support, European officials say, might take various forms such as U.S. air defenses that are operated from countries outside Ukraine, the provision of air-defense systems to the European forces in Ukraine, heavy lift to transport European peacekeepers and their equipment, intelligence support and long-range U.S. missile systems to protect them.

Any such military involvement by Western nations would be incompatible with the Istanbul understandings as drafted in 2022, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Moscow hasnt agreed to the idea.

President Trump has declined to say whether the U.S. might provide any indirect support for a prospective European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, saying a peace agreement needed to be hammered out first. 

Im not going to make security guarantees beyond very much, Trump said during his cabinet meeting Wednesday. But were going to make sure everything goes well. 

A senior Trump administration official said Thursday that the U.S. has ruled out putting boots on the ground in Ukraine but left open the possibility that some forms of indirect support might be open for discussion as long as U.S. troops werent in harms way.

Updated March 3, 2025 at 1:17 pm ET

BRUSSELSThe argument between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart at the White House sent [relations between the two countries](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-peace-deal-64d05419?mod=article_inline) into a tailspin. It also caused serious damage to an alliance at the heart of the post-World War II order: NATO.

Trump staked out a position that many European allies saw as siding with Russias autocratic leader, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin), by dismissing the security concerns of a friendly country in need of Western help. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was losing the war and had no cards.

The American presidents embrace of Russia, an adversary that has worked for years to undermine U.S. global leadership, runs counter to decades of Western policy. The U.S. and its allies founded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 75 years ago as protection against Soviet Russia.

NATO is based on the idea that the U.S. would use its military might, including its arsenal of nuclear weapons, to come to the defense of any ally that is attacked. That bedrock assumption has now been called into question.

https://preview.redd.it/782vv3nxxime1.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b171634659b92de5e5ea3a628b98215e2874474

I worry that we may be in the last days of NATO, said retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, who served as NATOs supreme allied commander. He said the trans-Atlantic alliance may not be about to collapse, but I can sure hear it creaking louder than at any time in my long career in the military.

Trump on Sunday wrote on his Truth Social platform: We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our CountrySo that we dont end up like Europe! Last week, he said the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States.

The White House, in response to a question Monday about Trumps faith in NATO, pointed to his comments Thursday at a news conference with British Prime Minister [Keir Starmer](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/keir-starmer). Asked there if he supports NATOs mutual-defense clause, Article 5 of its founding treaty, Trump said, I support it.

The strength of Trumps support for NATO has varied over time and by area of focus. On Friday, with Zelensky, he said, were committed to NATO and praised alliance member Poland, which spends heavily on defense. He was less enthusiastic in his support for the high-spending Baltic states, which are also in NATO.

On Saturday, billionaire [Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk), a Trump adviser who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, endorsed a post advocating U.S. withdrawal from NATO and the United Nations on his social-media platform, X.

European leaders, who rely on NATO for their countries security, have refrained from talking publicly about mortal threats to the alliance, but some are starting to talk about alternate plans.

We want to preserve the trans-Atlantic partnership and our joint strength, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Saturday. But yesterday showed once again that we Europeans must not be naive, she said, referring to events Friday at the White House. We must take responsibility for our own interests, our own values and our own security, for the sake of our people in Europe.

European leaders [met in London on Sunday](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/white-house-clash-raises-tough-question-for-ukraine-how-long-could-it-fight-without-u-s-f780e8c1?mod=article_inline), pledged to develop a peace plan for Ukraine and dismissed suggestions that Fridays White House meeting had damaged the trans-Atlantic alliance. I do not accept that the U.S. is an unreliable ally, said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The U.K. and France are leading efforts to develop a coalition of the willing that would secure an eventual cease-fire in Ukraine, including by deploying ground troops and military assets. They hope that by doing so, they will manage to convince Trump to contribute to their plan some vital U.S. military resources where Europe falls short, such as in systems for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command-and-control, air-defense and heavy airlift.

https://preview.redd.it/olxqdxb5yime1.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dbdc520738f32f87ab5dd4beecc8019613b916a

Europe lacks what military tacticians call enablementthe systems and equipment that enable modern military actionboth for a potential Ukraine operation and Europes own defense. European NATO members dont have those capabilities because of a mix of their own underinvestment and Americas longstanding preference to be in control of such systems. In NATOs traditional division of labor, broadly speaking, Europe was envisioned as contributing the mass of forces while the U.S. would provide sophisticated systems and cohesion for coalition forces.

The current crisis flips Europes longstanding security dilemma on its head. For years, U.S. strategists fretted over whether they could fend off hostility from Moscow if Europe didnt pull its weight militarily. Now it is Europeans who are in a sweat, wondering if they can defend against Russia without the U.S.

Europeans are wise to be concerned and to build up their own military industry and capabilities, said Rose Gottemoeller, a former NATO deputy secretary-general and chief U.S. arms negotiator with Russia. 

Gottemoeller said concern about U.S. commitment first flared in 2017, at the start of Trumps first term, when he stood in front of NATOs new headquarters building and [refused to endorse](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-declines-to-back-core-nato-tenet-to-dismay-of-european-allies-1495730615?mod=article_inline) the alliances core mutual-defense pact unless Europeans raised military spending.

Since then, European outlays have jumped. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on his first trip to NATOs headquarters recently affirmed Americas commitment to the alliance and its core tenet of collective security, while still admonishing Europeans to spend even more.

https://preview.redd.it/gekex5y7yime1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef0951b2e249d519b5cb396386e97eec04f132e

The difference now is the administrations view of threats from Russia. Trump and his team [are engaging with Russia](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-seeks-to-reset-tense-ties-with-russia-1b4f3d35?mod=article_inline), siding with Putin and rejecting [traditional U.S. wariness of the Kremlin](https://www.wsj.com/world/trump-putin-russia-china-policy-e73aeea6?mod=article_inline) to a degree unprecedented since World War IIand by some measures since the founding of the Soviet Union more than a century ago.

Most European leaders, meanwhile, still see Putins Russia as a threat.

A large-scale Russian attack on Europe doesnt appear imminent, but the prospect of an armistice in Ukraine is raising European anxiety. Many of Washingtons traditional allies worry that a deal could put Russia in position to rebuild its battered military, economy and global standing without simultaneously boosting European security.

A [recent survey](https://europeangovernanceandpolitics.eui.eu/global-risks-eu/) of almost 400 European international-security professionals assessing 30 potential high-impact dangers to the EU this year identified a Ukraine cease-fire favorable to Russia as the gravest potential threat on the list. The survey was conducted between the U.S. election and Trumps inauguration.

https://preview.redd.it/4fgx72uayime1.png?width=2548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea885be2b4082b2b46e540618ca5cc824a8d0d4d

U.S. isolationism and a withdrawal of its security guarantees to Europe ranked almost on par with a bad Ukraine deal among threats listedand comparable to the danger of a Russian nuclear strike, according to the study, led by the European University Institute.

European worries are confirmed by what weve seen over recent weeks, said survey organizer Veronica Anghel.

European governments are sprinting belatedly to rebuild their militaries, compelled by fear of attack by Russia and abandonment by the U.S. Leaders of the EUs 27 countries will gather in Brussels on Thursday to hash out plans to boost military spending and its ability to handle security challenges independently.

One big catch: The EU isnt a military organization and its work is focused on coordinating members efforts while boosting Europes atrophied, inefficient arms industry. 

https://preview.redd.it/yiy8rzveyime1.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46ddc938d6c20944266d2b6246dcdb0760974091

In terms of military action, European efforts fit within plans drawn up at NATO over the past three years, following Russias large-scale invasion of Ukraine. While European investments will bolster the continents defenses, they slot into a grand design premised on American participation. The new European equipment and units are part of NATO battle plans and command structures. 

Europe has no continentwide military command outside NATO. The U.S. spent decades ensuring that by co-opting or squelching any effort by allied European governments to create rival military groupings. Europeans have repeatedly talked about establishing a multinational fighting force but made little headway.

Now Europeans are pondering what collective defense might look like without the U.S. Talk of defending Ukraine is focusing European thinking on how to establish a command structure not built around U.S. capabilities. The next step would be considering how to defend European territory without relying on American systems.

If you expect Trump will deal transactionally with Europe or disengageor bothyou have to prepare for both, said Giuseppe Spatafora, a former NATO planner and now a research analyst at the EU Institute for Security Studies, the blocs external-policy think tank. 

How you make up for the U.S. commitment is a political question, and one that must be discussed and acted upon now, said Spatafora.

The German Taurus is a 1.5-ton cruise missile with a turbofan engine propelling it to high subsonic speeds over a distance of around 300 miles under GPS and inertial guidance. Most importantly, it packs an 1,100-pound dual warhead with a smaller charge to blow a hole in the target and a bigger charge to explode the target from the inside.

The missiles high-tech features explain why the Ukrainian air force has been so desperate to get its hands on the Taurus. The same features are why the government of German chancellor Olaf Scholz has consistently rejected repeated Ukrainian requests for the missile. I do not think it is right to deliver destructive weapons deep into the Russian hinterland, Scholz said last month.

But Scholzs party, the social democrats, came in third place in the recent German elections, trailing the first-place conservatives and the second-place far right. And the new chancellor-in-waiting, conservative Friedrich Merz, isnt as strategically timid as Scholz. Merz endorsed a possible missile transfer last fall.

All that is to say, Ukraine is likely to get some Tauruses. The only questions are: How many? How will it use them? And how soon?","UkraineRussiaReport",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j2pq1n/ua_pov_ukraine_is_about_to_hang_german_missiles/"

On the morning of 24 February, I woke just before seven as a tentative apricot dawn was spreading over scrubby flatlands dusted with light snow. The secret train was trundling into an unprepossessing town, houses scattered amid spindly pines, nothing to write home about. I didnt even look for a station sign as theyd all been removed to fox Vladimir Putins mercenaries. This country is under martial law, a curfew, and as morning was breaking Ukraine was entering the fourth year of fighting off its vast neighbours vicious and unwanted advances.

Wed boarded the previous night near the Polish border (I know it sounds ridiculous but I am not allowed to say where) and I had claimed my couchette with toddler excitement. Two pillows, crisp sheets, comforter and brown-paper-bag dinner which I consumed immediately, including both mini bottles of red and white wine and marshmallows for pudding.

My cabin-mate was battle-hardened Dame Shelley Williams-Walker, formerly at No. 10, now Boriss press agent, travel agent and personal organiser. She is also a lethally effective bouncer, I found, as people can crowd him for selfies. Especially here. Big in Ukraine. Not a lot of people know this but here croissants are confected with messy yellow icing in his honour, streets are renamed Boris Johnson Street (in a town near Odessa) and theres even a pub in Kyiv with murals of, yes, you guessed.

When one Channel 4 telly anchor texted me to ask my brother to give him an interview on the anniversary, I put him off, saying I didnt handle his media and anyway, he was too busy. Which was true. Its the one country where they still like him, was the ungracious reply.

I found I took like duck to water to introducing myself to people as seester of Borees if anyone wanted to talk to me, which they didnt really. Shelley, aka The Shellster, is soft on fans but adamantine when telly hacks shout Over here Boris, Good Morning Britain  as I found out in the capital an hour or so later  but for now, we are still on the train.

As there were no signs to tell us where we were, I opened Google Maps on my phone, and noticed that a derelict house by the track had its roof stoved in. Oh, and another. The travelling blue dot on Google Maps told me Id woken in Bucha, a dormitory town of Kyiv. This is where many innocent townspeople had been tied up and shot in the head for the crime of being Ukrainian, a town where mass graves were discovered and the Russians had claimed the murders had been staged or carried out by the Ukrainian army.

Minutes later, breakfast arrived in a brown paper bag. I wasnt hungry enough to face the croissant with beef and vegetables, although Boris told me later (he was in the couchette next door) that hed managed to choke his down.

The train arrived in Kyiv at 8 a.m. and one of the advantages of being entourage was getting into a waiting convoy and driving across the train tracks to leave the station, while others had to queue for the coach. That was pleasing. In my position as seester of, you have to take the wins, you know.

At 11 p.m., back in my room, the air raid siren went off. Then a Tannoyed announcement to go to the basement

I would say that the heavy hours of the day commemorating yet another anniversary of a pointless illegal war passed in a blur of interviews, panels and speaking to world leaders  but I cant speak for Boris, who is continuously referred to here and on stage as Prime Minister, despite his feeble protests.

Dinner was with a former Ukraine ambassador to London and Charles Moore of this parish, a splendid local feast of platters of sliced fat, borscht served in hollowed-out cabbages, pierogi and squirty chicken kievs, washed down with horseradish vodka, almost every dish served with a blob of sour cream. At 11 p.m., back in my room, the air raid siren went off. Then a Tannoyed announcement to go to the basement.

I opened my window and watched the drones streak past the golden domes of churches like shooting stars and went down, as ordered, into the bomb shelter. Do I have to stay down here all night? I asked a Chinese American from the World Bank. He said no, I could go back to my room but to stay well away from the window. Then he glanced around the other guests seated at tables and looked confident hed given me sound advice. If its cruise missiles, he explained, and not Shahed drones, the Americans would be down here. They get better intel.

On 24 February I began the day in Bucha and ended it in a bomb shelter and the sound of gunfire in the night sky. It makes an anecdote, I guess. A diary entry.

But this is all day every day for the indomitable Ukrainians, the bravest people I know, for three long years. If only the darkest hour was just before dawn.

https://preview.redd.it/6zu8hdouzlle1.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20524e7c39b1b115e1362f336fde54a0dba9eb89

Feb 25th 2025

Within hours of his party winning national elections, [Friedrich Merz](https://archive.is/o/heFwz/https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/02/23/merz-wins-a-messy-election-then-calls-for-independence-from-america), Germanys presumptive next leader, offered a bombshell on national television. Donald Trump does not care much about the fate of Europe, he told Germans, and the priority was to step by step&achieve independence from the usa. This was not some distant objective. He was unsure, he said, whether nato would still exist in its current form in June, when leaders are due to meet in the Netherlands, or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability much more quickly.

If anyone thought Mr Merz was being alarmist they were swiftly disabused. On February 24th America sided with Russia and North Korea in voting against a unresolution proposed by its European allies that blamed Russia for invading Ukraine. It then pushed through its own resolution in the Security Council with the support of Russia and China that called for a swift end to the war, but without repeating previous calls of support for Ukraines territorial integrity.

Mr Merz is not the only staunch transatlanticist flirting with radical ideas over the future of nato in the face of Donald Trumps assault on the alliance that kept the peace in Europe for nearly eight decades. The security architecture that Europe has relied on for generations is gone and is not coming back, writes Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former secretary-general of nato, in [an essay for *The Economist*](https://archive.is/o/heFwz/https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2025/02/24/the-transatlantic-relationship-is-crumbling-says-an-ex-head-of-nato). Europe must come to terms with the fact that we are not only existentially vulnerable, but also seemingly alone.

In truth, it could take a decade before Europe is able to defend itself without Americas help. To understand Europes challenge, start with the debate over Ukraine. European countries are currently discussing the prospect of a military deployment in Ukraine to enforce any future peace deal. The talks, which are being led by France and [Britain](https://archive.is/o/heFwz/https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/02/19/how-britons-became-happy-hawks-on-russia), envisage [sending a relatively modest force](https://archive.is/o/heFwz/https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/02/17/the-nightmare-of-a-trump-putin-deal-leaves-europe-in-shock), of perhaps low tens of thousands of troops. They would not be deployed in the east at the front line, but to Ukrainian cities, ports, nuclear power plants and other critical national infrastructure, according to a Western official.

Any such deployment would, however, expose three serious weaknesses. One is that it would stretch European forces thin. There are approximately 230 Russian and Ukrainian brigades in Ukraine, though most are understrength. Many European countries would struggle to produce one combat-capable brigade each. Second, it would open up serious gaps in Europes own defences. A British deployment to Ukraine, for instance, would probably swallow up units currently earmarked as high-readiness and reserve forces for nato, leaving holes in the alliances war plans. Above all, the Europeans acknowledge that any deployment would need significant American support not only in the form of specific enablers, such as intelligence and air-defence assets, but also the promise of back-up should Russia attack.

The fact that Europe would struggle to generate an independent division-sized force for Ukraine demonstrates the scale of the task involved in Mr Merzs vision. Meeting natos existing war planswith America presentwould require Europe to spend 3% of gdp on defence, far above existing levels for most countries. Britain took a step in that direction on February 25th, announcing a plan to spend 2.5% of gdp by 2027, but even that may not be enough. Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of nato, is said to be touting a target of 3.7%. But making good American shortfalls would require a figure well above 4%, probably much higher.

Paying for that would be hard enough. But translating cash into capability is also harder than it looks. Europe would need to form 50 new brigades, calculates Bruegel, a Brussels-based think-tank, many of them heavy units with armour, to replace the 300,000 American troops that it estimates would be deployed to the continent in a war. The manpower requirements would be forbidding, given that European armies struggle to recruit enough people even at their current sizes.

These figures are guesstimates. Bruegels suggestion that Europe would need 1,400 tanks to prevent a Russian breakthrough in the Baltic states reflects traditional planning assumptions and is probably on the high side. In any case, this sort of bean counting tells only half the story. Deploying credible military forces requires not just combat forces themselves, but also less visible capabilities. Europe has impressive air forces with a lot of modern jets. But those jets do not have a meaningful stockpile of munitions capable of destroying enemy air defences or striking distant targets on land or in the air, explains Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute (rusi), a think-tank in London, in a forthcoming paper. Nor do their pilots and crews train sufficiently. Only some air forces, like those of Sweden, have maintained pilot proficiency for demanding high-intensity aerial warfare. Moreover, airborne electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (istar), or the ability to find and understand targets, are almost exclusively provided by the us, notes Mr Bronk.

Another glaring problem is command and control, or the institutions and individuals that actually co-ordinate and lead large military formations in times of war. nato has a sprawling set of headquarters across Europe, with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (shape) in Mons, Belgium, at the top, led by Chris Cavoli who, like every Supreme Allied Commander Europe (saceur) before him, is an American. nato co-ordination is often a euphemism for us staff officers, says Matthew Savill, a former British defence official now at rusi.

European expertise in running big formations is overwhelmingly concentrated in British and French officers, he saysboth countries oversee saceurs two reserve corps, which are very high-level headquarters that sit above divisionsthough Turkey and Poland, with large and growing armies, are getting better. But Britain, he says, would probably be incapable of running a complex air operation on the same scale and intensity as that of Israels air war in Gaza and Lebanon. Were still absorbing the lessons of modern ai-assisted data-basing and targeting, warns Mr Savill. There is nothing that Im aware of that Europe has that actually approaches the scale of what the Israelis have allegedly done.

If Europeans are able to generate and command their own forces, the next question is whether they could be kept fed with munitions. [Europes artillery production](https://archive.is/o/heFwz/https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/14/can-europe-arm-ukraine-or-even-itself) has skyrocketed over the past three years, though Russia, aided by North Korea, remains ahead. There are also a handful of advanced European missile-makers: mbda, a pan-European company with headquarters in France, makes one of the worlds best air-to-air missiles, the Meteor. France, Norway and Germany make excellent air-defence systems. Turkey is turning into a serious defence-industrial player.

Between February 2022 and September 2024, European nato states procured 52% of new systems from within Europe and bought just 34% from America, according to a recent paper by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (iiss), another think-tank. But that 34% is often vital. Europe needs America for rocket artillery, longer-range air defence and stealthy aircraft. Even for simpler weapons, demand far outstrips capacity, one reason why European countries have turned to Brazil, Israel and South Korea for armoured vehicles and artillery shells.

The level of dependence on America is not uniform across the continent. Britain, for instance, is uniquely intertwined with Americas military, intelligence machinery and industry. If America were to cut off access to satellite imagery and other geospatial information, such as terrain maps, the consequences would be profound. Perhaps the main reason that Britain required Americas assent to allow Ukraine to fire British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia last year is that the missiles relied on American geospatial data for effective targeting. Britain would have to spend billions to buy replacement images, says Mr Savill, or turn to France, which maintains its own sovereign capabilities in this area. On the other hand, British entanglement with America can also provide leverage. Around 15% of components in the f-35 jet used by American and allied forces are made by Britain, including tricky-to-replace parts like the ejector seat.

If the enormous task of building truly independent conventional armed forces were not daunting enough, Europe faces another challenge. For 80 years its conventional forces have also sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. If Europe is really alone, as Mr Rasmussen claims, and as many fear, then the problem is not just that American troops would not fight for Europe. It is also that American nuclear weapons, both the strategic ones that reach deep into Russia, and the sub-strategic ones which America deploys in Europe for carriage by European air forces, might also be absent.

On February 21st Mr Merz thrust that problem into the open. We need to have discussions with both the British and the Frenchthe two European nuclear powers, he suggested, about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security&could also apply to us. In practice, Britain and France cannot replicate Americas nuclear shield over Europe. One problem is the relatively small size of their arsenalsaround 400 warheads between them, compared to more than 1,700 deployed Russian warheads. American nuclear insiders sniff at the idea that this is adequate for deterrence, because they believe that Russia would be able to limit the damage to itself (never mind that Moscow might be gone) while inflicting worse on Europe. Doubling or tripling the size of the Anglo-French arsenals would probably take years and cannibalise money needed to build up conventional forces; in Britain the deterrent already consumes a fifth of defence spending.

Another issue is that although France has nuclear weapons aboard submarines and planes, Britain has only the former, which limits its ability to engage in nuclear signaling in a crisis, for instance by using low-yield nuclear weapons, since doing so would risk exposing the position of its submarines and thereby put its strategic deterrent at risk. Moreover, although Britain can fire its nuclear weapons without American permission, it leases the missiles from Americathose not aboard submarines are held in a joint pool in the state of Georgiaand relies on American co-operation for components like the re-entry vehicle which houses the warhead.

These are problems; but they need not be insurmountable ones. Quiet conversations on European nuclear deterrence among European defence ministers have picked up in recent months. The German debate is maturing at warp speed, notes Bruno Tertrais, one of Europes leading thinkers on nuclear matters. The British and the French will need to rise to the challenge.

Nuclear deterrence is not just a numbers game, he writes, but a question of will. Mr Putin might take more seriously threats of mutual destruction from Paris or London than from Washington, Mr Tertrais argues. These are the questions that preoccupied European thinkers throughout the cold war; their return marks a new and dark period for the continent. This, pronounced Mr Merz on February 24th, is really five minutes to midnight for Europe.  ","UkraineRussiaReport",96,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iz8dgk/ua_povcan_europe_confront_vladimir_putins_russia/"

https://www.youtube.com/live/s9V-UtD3flY?si=kvLO4e3eeIVTUS9N


BELOW ARE THOSE PRO-NATO PRO-INTERVENTIONIST ARGUMENTS AGAINST JEFFREY SACHS:

Jeffrey Sachs is presenting a one-sided historical revisionism that conveniently ignores some key realities:

NATO never promised not to expand. The claim that the West pledged not to move NATO one inch eastward is a persistent myth. There was no formal treaty or written agreementonly verbal discussions during German reunification that never led to a binding commitment. More importantly, former Soviet officials, including Gorbachev himself, later admitted that NATO expansion was not even on the table at the time.

NATO didnt force anyone to joinit was Eastern European nations themselves that sought protection. Poland, the Baltic states, and other former Soviet-controlled countries asked to join NATO precisely because they feared future Russian aggression. Russia has repeatedly invaded its neighborsGeorgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014 and 2022. Given that track record, why wouldnt former Soviet states want security guarantees?

Ukraine is not some pawn in an American projectits a sovereign nation that chose its own path. The Euromaidan protests in 2014 werent a NATO plot; they were a popular uprising against a corrupt pro-Russian government. Ukraine made clear that it wanted closer ties to the EU and Western institutions. Russias response? It annexed Crimea and fueled a separatist war in Donbas.

If NATO expansion was the problem, why did Russia invade non-NATO Ukraine? Ukraine was not in NATO in 2014 or 2022. If Russias invasion was merely about stopping NATO, why attack a country that wasnt in the alliance? The answer: Putin sees Ukraine as part of Russias imperial sphere and seeks to erase its sovereignty.

Blaming the U.S. for every conflict is a convenient dodge for Putins aggression. Yes, the U.S. has made foreign policy mistakes, but Sachs broad-brush narrative ignores Russias own history of violent interventions, assassinations, cyber warfare, and election meddling. Claiming the Ukraine war is just another U.S.-caused conflict ignores Putins own stated imperial ambitions.

Sachs argument boils down to: The U.S. has done bad things, therefore Russias full-scale invasion of a sovereign country is justified. Thats not an argumentits an evasion.","UkraineRussiaReport",28,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j2usun/ru_pov_pronato_prointerventionist_arguments_i/"
"2025-03-03",1740968126,"UA POV : Macron proposes one month truce in Ukraine, EU troops will not be sent in coming weeks but later :1News","[Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, front center, hosts the European leaders' summit to discuss Ukraine, at Lancaster House, London. \(Source: Associated Press\)](https://preview.redd.it/azrgzloiudme1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3da40d18348540eabf25e52ceecb8ea728562f)

[Link](https://www.1news.co.nz/2025/03/03/starmer-says-europe-at-crossroads-in-history-as-leaders-discuss-ending-ukraine-war/)

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts today to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russias war.

French President Emmanuel Macron also suggested he and Starmer were proposing a ""truce in the air, on the seas, and energy infrastructures"" that would last a month.

Starmer's exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after US backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for America's support.

""Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,"" said Starmer.

The meeting had been overshadowed by the [extraordinary scolding](https://www.1news.co.nz/2025/03/01/trump-cuts-short-talks-with-zelensky-after-oval-office-blow-up/) that took place on live television at the White House. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the US and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday's spat.

Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders  mostly from Europe  had agreed on four things.

The steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine's hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security; and continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion.

Finally, Starmer said they would develop a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine and guarantee the peace.

""Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can't mean that we sit back,"" he said. ""Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others.""

It is far from certain whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept any such plan, which Starmer said would require strong US backing. He did not specify what that meant, though he told the BBC before the summit that there were ""intense discussions"" to get a security guarantee from the US.

""If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,"" Starmer said.

Starmer said he will later bring a more formal plan to the US and work with Trump.

**Before arriving in London, French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in an interview with a French newspaper that he and Starmer are proposing a ""truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures"" that would last a month.**

**There would be no European troops in the coming weeks and troops would only be deployed on the ground at a later stage, he said.**

The question, Macron said, is ""how we use this time to try and get an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a deployment"".

**Two diplomatic steps forward, one back**

Europe has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cosying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelensky a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war.

Meetings last week had provided some hope  until Zelensky's trip to the White House on Friday.

Visits to the Oval Office by Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who had declared his visit a ""turning point,"" were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing US security guarantees and maintained that Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.

Within 12 hours of Starmer's return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky for challenging Trump's assertions that Putin could be trusted.

During his press conference, Starmer rejected the suggestion that the US was no longer a reliable ally.

""There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries and our defence, our security and intelligence is intertwined in a way no two other countries are, so it's an important and reliable ally for us,"" he said.

Starmer told the BBC before the summit that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said she was sorry for what happened with Zelensky in Washington. Meloni is both a strong Ukraine supporter and  as head of a far-right party  she is a natural ally of Trump. She was the only European leader to attend his inauguration.

She said told reporters following the meeting that Europe must remain focused on its common goals and that ""dividing the West would be disastrous for everyone.""

""We need to work to reinforce our unity, and I think that Italy can play a role, not just in its own interest, but in everyone's,"" she said. ""I don't want to take any other scenario into consideration.""

Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following his charm offensive with Macron to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the centre of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.

Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance.

Starmer used sweeping terms to describe the challenge ahead, saying Europe was at a crossroads in its history and needed to step up to meet ""once in a generation moment.""

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen emerged from the meeting and said she would present a plan to ""rearm Europe"" to bolster the bloc's security after a long period of underinvestment.

As for the future of war-torn Ukraine, von der Leyen said it needs security guarantees.

**""We have to put Ukraine in a position of strength so that it has the means to fortify itself and to protect itself,"" von der Leyen said. ""It's basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.""**

Last week, Starmer pledged to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Saturday that Europe faces a historic test and has to look after itself. He said European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach at least 3% of GDP.","UkraineRussiaReport",60,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j282pi/ua_pov_macron_proposes_one_month_truce_in_ukraine/"

President Trump cut short a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the two leaders engaged in a combative exchange over how to negotiate a settlement for the Russian-Ukraine conflict.

He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office, Trump wrote on social media. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.

Ukraine had sought the meeting to line up U.S. support against Russian aggression, which it hoped to solidify with the signing of a [mineral-rights deal](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/ukraine-agrees-to-mineral-rights-deal-with-u-s-3bbd871f?mod=article_inline)later in the day. But the visit ended without the scheduled press conference and the signing of the accord.

The abrupt end of the meeting left unclear how much military and political support the Trump administration is prepared to provide to Kyiv in coming months. It also muddied the prospects that a European peacekeeping force could be readied to secure a settlement if one is negotiated, since European leaders have signaled that such a deployment would need some form of American military support.

French and British leaders [had met with Trump](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europe-eu-leaders-trump-strategy-a8864ee0?mod=article_inline) earlier this week to appeal for a U.S. backstop for such a force and set the stage for what they hoped would be a constructive meeting between Zelensky and Trump.

The tensions between Zelensky and Trump burst into the open Friday in the Oval Office as the Ukrainian leader urged the U.S. not to trust Russia President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin) and Trump responded that Kyiv needed to accept that it had a weak negotiating hand.

But after a half-hour of a generally polite discussion, the tone of the session grew contentious as disagreements that typically occur behind closed doors spilled out into the open.

During the meeting Trump repeatedly said that he has a close relationship with Putin, and believes that the Russian leader will stick to a peace deal if one is struck. But Zelensky said that a U.S.-backed security guarantee is needed, and sought to explain to Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jd-vance) that Ukraine had signed a number of agreements with Russia that Moscow had subsequently broken.

Vance, and later Trump, said Zelensky hasnt been grateful enough for the assistance his military received from the U.S.

If you didnt have our military equipment, Ukraine would have lost the war in weeks, Trump said. He added: You have to be thankful. At one point, Trump told Zelensky he is gambling with World War III.

Zelensky said he has been thankful to the American people. But as the tense exchange continued, Trump provided a dire picture of Ukraines military situation. You are running low on soldiers, Trump said. Youre not in a good position&you dont have the cards.

Even as the back-and-forth grew more heated, Trump said he wanted the American people to see it, saying it would be great television. Zelensky urged Trump and Vance to visit Ukraine, but Vance dismissed trips there by foreign leaders as propaganda tours.

The session occurred shortly after Zelensky arrived at the White House, and Trump brought reporters into the Oval Office for what is typically a brief greeting. Other attendees included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Ukraine has agreed to turn over the revenue from some of its mineral resources to the United States, an American and a Ukrainian official said on Tuesday, in a deal that follows an intense pressure campaign from President Trump that included insults and threats.

https://preview.redd.it/xbguw9dj2dle1.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cd58d530b956ed4bfed16c021c169417e06be65

The final terms of the deal were unknown, and it was not immediately clear what, if anything, Ukraine would receive in return after days of difficult, sometimes tense negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had repeatedly pressed for security guarantees for his country in exchange for mineral rights, as Russias war has entered its fourth year.

Previous draft agreements reviewed by The New York Times included no such commitment. Mr. Trump had insisted he wanted payback for past military aid to Kyiv, shifting Americas alliance with Ukraine to a nakedly mercantile footing.

A final translated draft of the agreement was sent to Ukraine on Tuesday, according to the American official. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, the American official said, are expected to sign the agreement first and then Mr. Zelensky is expected to go to Washington for a signing with Mr. Trump. The American and Ukrainian officials insisted in speaking anonymously in order to describe private negotiations.

On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zelensky: I hear that hes coming on Friday. Certainly, its OK with me if hed like to.

Mr. Zelensky has been pressing for days to finalize any agreement with Mr. Trump in person. But the Ukrainian leader had rejected at least one other draft of an agreement because it lacked specific U.S. security guarantees and because Mr. Trump was requesting mineral rights worth $500 billion, along with other provisions that Ukraine considered unacceptable.

The Ukrainians became more comfortable with the deal in the past few days after the Americans removed some of the more onerous conditions.

The discussions about mineral rights have occurred as Russia has seized the advantage on the battlefield. Mr. Trump has also aligned himself with President Vladimir V. Putin while excoriating Mr. Zelensky.

Mr. Trump has called the Ukrainian president a dictator and falsely said that Ukraine had started the war, though the conflict began with Russias full-scale invasion in February 2022.

He has prodded Mr. Zelensky to sign a deal, saying he better move fast or he is not going to have a country left. In response, Mr. Zelensky said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a Russian disinformation bubble.

A testament to Mr. Trumps transactional approach to foreign affairs, the deal follows similar moves by the American president to leverage the United States economic power in pressuring allies like Canada and Colombia to comply with, or at least negotiate on, his demands.

Critics say a previous draft of the deal gave no consideration to the cost in lives that Ukraine has already paid toward Europes broader security  by defeating Russias initial invasion, preventing a Russian military presence on NATO borders farther west, and by grinding down Moscows army over three years of fierce fighting.

Mr. Zelensky had floated the idea of a resources deal last fall to provide an incentive for more U.S. military support. But he balked at the terms presented by the Trump administration when [Mr. Bessent visited Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Feb. 12](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/scott-bessent-us-ukraine.html).

One proposal would have Ukraine repay the United States twice the value of future American aid, Mr. Zelensky said.

I am not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to repay, he told a news conference. Still, the Ukrainian leader acknowledged that he might, ultimately, have little choice.

If we are forced and we cannot do without it, then we should probably go for it, he said, amid intensifying pressure.

The White House has argued that even without specific security guarantees, the mere presence of American economic interests in Ukraine would deter future Russian aggression.

What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States? Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser said last week.

# Zelensky's stubbornness has badly hurt Ukraine.

Today at 6:03 p.m. EST

https://preview.redd.it/9zfrmx2l2fme1.png?width=1742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81df15113188bd66aa4c63499435c29652890bb9

On Thursday, President Donald Trump was publicly pledging to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regain Russian-occupied territory at the peace table. A lot of the sea line has been taken, and well be talking about that, [Trump said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hosts-uks-keir-starmer-ukraine-talks-amid/story?id=119249871) during an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And were going to see if we can get it back or get a lot of it back for Ukraine.

A day later, Zelensky was engaged in an unprecedented [war of words](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/28/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky/) with Trump in the Oval Office  after which the planned signing of a historic minerals deal between the two countries [was shelved](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/01/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-putin-deal/).

The blowup was Zelenskys fault. To understand why, one needs to watch the entire [50-minute meeting](https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-meets-with-ukrainian-president-zelensky/656418) unfold. Trump greeted Zelensky graciously, praising the courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people, and dismissed their earlier rift as a little negotiations spat.

Even after Zelensky refused a White House request to wear a suit, Trump praised his outfit, saying, I think hes dressed beautifully. Trump extolled the minerals deal they had reached and said, We look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging. He publicly pledged to continue military aid to Ukraine and even held out the possibility that he could conceivably commit U.S. troops alongside British and French troops to provide security after a peace deal was reached.

This should have been music to Zelenskys ears. He should have taken the win. Instead, about 24 minutes in  long before his terse exchange with Vice President JD Vance  Zelensky started criticizing Trump in front of the assembled reporters.

He summarily dismissed Trumps idea of an immediate ceasefire  something that is extremely important to Trump, who is committed to stopping the killing  because he said Putin had already broken ceasefires 25 times.

He never broke to me, Trump said. No, no, you were the president, Zelensky contradicted him. He never broke to me, Trump repeated. Instead of letting it pass, Zelensky contradicted him again: In 2016, youve been the president, Mr. President he said, adding, Thats why we will never accept just a ceasefire. It will not work without security guarantees.

Why on earth did Zelensky choose to fact-check Trump in front of the entire world rather than debate the wisdom of a ceasefire behind closed doors?

A few moments later, after Trump bemoaned the destruction of Ukrainian cities, Zelensky interrupted him again. No, no, no, you have to come, Mr. President, you have to come and to look. No, no, no, we have very good cities. He then suggested that Trump was falling for Putins propaganda, declaring, iIts Putin that is sharing this information that he destroyed us. But Trump was right: Many Ukrainian cities [have been destroyed](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-destroyed-cities-russia-war/32454453.html).

Zelenskys intervention was reckless and unnecessary. He was in Washington to heal a breach that began with his public suggestion that Trump was living in a Russian [disinformation space](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kellogg-zelenskyy-437f4c8fa4531059007dd3ab00c23458)  a suggestion that prompted Trump to lash out and call Zelensky a dictator without elections. Why would he do it again? You could see Trumps demeanor stiffening with every public contradiction from Zelensky.

Then a Polish journalist asked Trump whether he had aligned himself too much with Putin. You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, Hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal? That doesnt work that way. That was when Vance jumped in. For four years in the United States of America, we had a president who stood up at news conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country, Vance said. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy.

There was no reason for Zelensky to comment on Vances anodyne intervention about the virtues of diplomacy. But he inserted himself into the discussion and chastised Vance, pointing out that during 2014 till 2022 & people have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him  effectively accusing Trump of standing by while Ukrainians were killed. He then underlined that Putin had broken a ceasefire he signed in 2019 while Trump was in office. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? Zelensky said, first-naming the vice president.

That was all the opening Vance, a Ukraine critic, needed. Im talking about the kind of diplomacy thats going to end the destruction of your country, Vance replied tersely, adding, Mr. President, with respect, I think its disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

After that, all hell broke loose.

Zelensky should not have litigated *any* disagreements with Trump in front of the media. As retired Gen. Jack Keane [noted on](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369457546112) Fox News, He should have understood going into the Oval Office today that when the cameras are on & the only answer to the questions should be, from Zelesnkys point, Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, America. Im going to work with you to achieve a peaceful end to this war. Period.

Keane is right. This should have been a backslapping, feel-good meeting celebrating the minerals deal. Instead, Zelensky hijacked the meeting, jumping in when he was not asked a question, looking for opportunities to interrupt and make his points. If he had kept quiet, the minerals deal would be signed, the United States would be financially invested in Ukraines independence, and he would be strategizing with Trump on how to get his territory back during negotiations. Instead, he has alienated the man on whom the fate of his country depends, a man who had just moments earlier been talking about the possibility of sending U.S. peacekeepers to Ukraine.

Even worse was Zelenskys stubborn refusal to apologize and to fix the breach. During a Fox News interview that evening (which Trump was almost certainly watching), Bret Baier gave Zelensky repeated opportunities to do so. Instead, the Ukrainian president doubled down. No, [Zelensky replied](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dni-gabbard-sounds-off-europes-divergence-us-values-after-tense-trump-zelenskyy-meeting) when asked whether he owed Trump an apology. I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and Im not sure that we did something bad. It was like watching a drowning man who keeps getting thrown a life preserver but refuses to grab it.

Zelensky should have stayed in Washington until the rift was mended. Trump gave him a way out. In a Truth Social post, he said Zelensky can come back when he is ready for Peace. Zelensky should have seized that opening and sent Trump a handwritten note expressing his sorrow that the meeting had gone off the rails, regretting the role he played in its demise, and declaring his intention to work with Trump for peace. Instead, he refused the off-ramp Trump offered him, got on his plane and left.

His stubbornness was an asset in February 2022, when he refused to flee Kyiv in the face of advancing Russian forces. But today, it is a liability. Zelensky snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. There was no ambush. He was set up for success. All he had to do was smile, thank Trump and the American people and sign the minerals deal. Instead, he handed Putin a victory, empowered anti-Ukraine Republicans, and weakened the hand of those who want to help Ukraine achieve a just and lasting peace.

The most generous explanation of Zelenskys conduct is that he is exhausted. He has been heroically leading a nation under brutal assault for three years. He regularly visits the front lines, where he sees the carnage Putin has unleashed firsthand. His emotions are running high,and his patience is thin.

But Zelensky does not have the luxury of getting emotional on the world stage. Europe does not have the military capabilities Ukraine needs to survive. Ukraine cannot have a president who is not on speaking terms with the president of the United States.

Right now, Zelensky seems incapable of managing his countrys relations with Trump. Trump can be magnanimous and has made the path to reconciliation clear: If Zelensky apologizes, Trump will invite him back the White House to sign the minerals pact and all will be forgiven. Right now, Zelensky is refusing, insisting he did nothing wrong. That is not sustainable. Either Zelensky needs to apologize and mend the breach, or he needs to step down and allow someone else to do it.","UkraineRussiaReport",92,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j2casm/ua_povopinion_zelensky_should_apologize_to_trump/"

A common reaction to that notorious Trump/Zelensky press conference is we havent seen anything like this before. Seen is the key word. 

Bust-ups and walk-outs do occur in diplomacy, the difference is that Donald Trump does in the open what is meant to be conducted in private. An example: in 2022, NBC reported that Joe Biden had spoken to Zelensky by phone about a $1	billion aid package, and when Zelensky began asking for more, the US president lost his temper and told him to be more grateful. 

So, yes, America argues with its friends. Worse than that: it has a record of abandoning them. Im struck by the parallel between Ukraine and South Vietnam, two regimes encouraged by the US to fight an invader  at huge cost in money and lives  only for Washington to cut and run. 

Americas stake was far greater in Vietnam (it lost about 58,000 soldiers trying to see off the Viet Cong) and Richard Nixon, unlike Trump, attempted to strengthen his allys hand with devastating bombing raids. But Nixon had promised his voters peace and, in December 1972, his administration suggested terms to South Vietnams President Thieu. 

If you want a sense of how the sausage is made in foreign policy, read the transcripts of Nixons conversations with national security adviser Henry Kissinger. Thieu, it seems, rejected a peace deal that would be generous to the Viet Cong; Kissinger called him a cheap, self-serving son-of-a-b----, criminal and insane. He suggested cutting off Thieus economic and military aid and doing a Diem on him  referring to a coup détat in 1963 that resulted in the assassination of one of Thieus predecessors, Ngo Dinh Diem. Henry and Dick were discussing murder, but that was part of the job. 

To keep face, they decided to bomb the Viet Cong a bit more  then offered it ceasefire terms obviously unfavourable to their own ally. (We bombed \[the enemy\] into accepting our concessions, explained Kissinger). Thieu was left with a promise of ongoing US funding, what you might call a backstop, but Congress, including a young Joe Biden, soon voted to turn off the tap.

South Vietnam fell in 1975. Some politicians opposed accepting refugees almost as vociferously as Trump does today. Decades later, Biden applied the withdrawal method to Afghanistan, believing voters were tired of building democracy in exotic locales.

All foreign policy is domestic. Rightly so. Presidents are elected to represent Ohio and Alabama, not Kabul or Kyiv, and as circumstances change it would be madness to stick to a failed policy. What confuses outsiders about America is that its ideals are universal, all men created equal etc, so it sounds as if its operating out of the goodness of its heart. We shall pay any price, said John F Kennedy, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty. (The Diem coup, incidentally, happened on Kennedys watch.)

Historian Mark Whites latest, very good book, Icon, Libertine, Leader, suggests that Kennedy believed those words, that he entered office in thrall to his generals and the novels of Ian Fleming. He approved a disastrous invasion of Cuba and, probably, some plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. His strategy likely agitated the Soviets and gave a pretext for sending nuclear weapons to Cuba in 1962, bringing us closer to World War Three than weve ever been. Some argue that Kennedys diplomacy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, though brilliant, de-escalated a drama he had helped to cause.

Trump would have been 16 years old during Cuba. Does he remember it? Most people my age have no memory of living with the fear of a nuclear exchange, but it conditioned an entire generations attitude towards Russian relations  and Donald mentions the risks often. 

Thats why hes reluctant to provide security guarantees for a country outside Nato, which puts him in the tradition of non-interference adopted during the Soviet invasion of Hungary, in 1956. Today it is taken for granted that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato if it so wishes, but as late as 1998, when senators discussed Natos expansion, politicians of a less utopian era warned about poking the Russian bear. 

As for fawning over Moscows leaders, as Trump does Putin, even Harry Truman, the wisest eagle of all, wrote in his diary, I can deal with Stalin. He is honest  but smart as hell. This did not stop him defending Europe or Korea when the communists went on the march, but the point is that politicians can be charmed, awed, fooled or irritated by choices as small as not wearing a tie.

While many historians agree that Trump is something unseen before, a few might conclude hes the most American president weve ever had  his chief novelty being transparency. Viewers of the press conference were shocked by his volatility, but when he said you dont have the cards, he expressed the way countless administrations have handled smaller countries, including our own. The reason why British policy consists solely of trying to persuade the US to support our goals is because the Americans previously undermined our ability to act as an independent power.

They made demolition of the empire a tacit condition for their support during the Second World War. The US insisted on creating a unipolar world and now complains about having to police it almost on its own. The irony.

Ex-spy Warnigs plan to involve American investors shows breadth of Trumps rapprochement with Russian president - FINANCIAL TIMES","[https://archive.ph/sXwPK#selection-1737.0-1741.112](https://archive.ph/sXwPK#selection-1737.0-1741.112)

A former spy and close friend of Vladimir Putin has been engineering a restart of Russias Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe with the backing of US investors, a once unthinkable move that shows the breadth of Donald Trumps rapprochement with Moscow.

The efforts on a deal, according to several people aware of the discussions, were the brainchild of Matthias Warnig, an ex-Stasi officer in East Germany who until 2023 ran Nord Stream 2s parent company for the Kremlin-controlled gas giant Gazprom.

Warnigs plan involved outreach to the Trump team through US businessmen, the people said, as part of back-channel efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine while deepening economic ties between the US and Russia.

Some prominent Trump administration figures are aware of the initiative to bring in US investors, according to officials in Washington, and they see it as part of the push to rebuild relations with Moscow.

While there have been several expressions of interest, one US-led consortium of investors has drawn up the outlines of a post-sanctions deal with Gazprom, according to one person with direct knowledge of talks who declined to disclose the identity of the prospective investors.

Senior EU officials became aware of the Nord Stream 2 discussion in recent weeks. Leaders of several European countries are concerned and have discussed the matter, according to several officials with knowledge of the discussions.

One of Nord Stream 2s two pipelines was blown up in sabotage attacks in September 2022 that destroyed both pipelines of its older sister project Nord Stream 1. The other Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has an annual capacity of 27.5bn cubic metres of natural gas, is undamaged but has never been used.

The latest plan would in theory give the US unparalleled sway over energy supplies to Europe, the people said, after EU countries moved to end their dependence on Russian gas in the aftermath of the invasion.

But the obstacles are considerable. It would require the US to lift sanctions against Russia, Russia to agree to resume sales it cut off during the war, and Germany to allow the gas to flow to any potential buyers in Europe.

The US would say, Well, now Russia will be dependable because trustworthy Americans are in the middle of it, said a former senior US official, who was aware of some of the dealmaking efforts. The US investors would collect money for nothing, he added.

Nord-stream-leaks-map

The talks come as the Trump administration races to seal a peace deal through bilateral discussions with Russia that have excluded Europe and Ukraine, spooking European capitals who fear a US détente with Moscow could threaten the continent. Trump has promised deeper economic co-operation with Russia if a peace agreement can be reached.

Putin, Russias president, has talked up the economic benefits he says the US could reap with the Kremlin in the event of a settlement in Ukraine, claiming that several companies were already in touch over potential deals.

Nord Stream 2 AG, the pipelines Swiss-based parent company, received an exceptional stay on bankruptcy proceedings in January by at least four months.

According to a redacted court document, Nord Stream 2s shareholder  Gazprom  argued that the new Trump administration, as well as the German election in February 2025, presumably can have significant consequences on the circumstances of Nord Stream 2 to warrant a delay. The submission pointed to complex geopolitical affairs and the sanctions regime.

Warnig told the Financial Times he was not involved in any discussions with any American politicians or business representatives, adding that he was following in this respect the rules \[as a\] US sanctioned person.

Dmitry Peskov, Putins spokesman, said he had no information on any talks regarding the pipeline. Gazprom declined to comment. A lawyer representing Nord Stream 2 in Swiss insolvency proceedings and a court-appointed custodian of Nord Steam 2 creditors did not respond to FT requests for comment.

Warnig, 69, has said he became a close friend of Putins in the 1990s after setting up an office for lender Dresdner Bank in St Petersburg, where the then-unknown Putin headed the citys foreign relations committee.

The two became so close that Putin asked Warnig to put up his daughters at the bankers house in Rödermark when their mother was seriously injured in a car accident.

Putin, who speaks fluent German, taught Warnigs children to ski in Davos and invited him to his fathers funeral, according to a 2023 interview with the former Stasi officer in Die Zeit.

But Warnig called Putins invasion an indescribable mistake and resigned from the boards of two Kremlin-run energy companies after the war in Ukraine broke out in 2022.

He told Die Zeit that he made a personal appeal to Putin to end the invasion a few months in and said the Russian president was so isolated that the only person who can still say something to him is me.

Warnig left Nord Stream 2 AG, the Russian-owned company that manages the pipeline, in 2023, but told Die Zeit that Gazproms chief executive, Alexei Miller, had guaranteed to cover its costs in the hope of saving what remained.

Joe Bidens US administration sanctioned Warnig and Nord Stream 2 AG in 2022. Biden officials showed little interest in a proposal to buy Nord Stream 2 last year from Stephen Lynch, an American businessman with a record of working in Russia.

Other potential investors have come forward since Lynch first expressed interest. The person with direct knowledge of Gazproms discussions said its advanced talks were with a different US-led consortium from Lynch.

Lynch declined to comment when contacted by the FT. He has applied for a licence from the US Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control for the Nord Stream proposal. Lynch was previously granted one to bid for the former Swiss subsidiary of sanctioned Russian lender Sberbank in 2022.

Trump was outspoken in his criticism of the pipeline during his first term as president. It has become a symbol for those who blamed Germany  and Europe by extension  for relying too much on Russian gas and helping to finance Moscows military machine.

But some of Trumps team now see the pipeline, which runs from Russias Vyborg in the Gulf of Finland to Greifswald on Germanys Baltic coast, as a strategic asset that can be leveraged in the Ukraine peace talks, according to administration officials.

The complex ownership structure of Nord Stream 2 presents serious potential obstacles for any investment.

Nord Stream 2 is 100 per cent owned by Gazprom. But five European energy companies  Shell, Uniper, OMV, Engie and Wintershall  collectively provided around half of its $11bn construction costs through loans. All five European companies have written off those debts.

The German government in 2022 pulled the plug on the licensing procedure of Nord Stream 2 and never issued the paperwork required to operate it.

Ownership of the pipeline could in theory give US investors a lever to control Russian gas flows to Europe, which is a key market for US liquefied natural gas exports shipped across the Atlantic in tankers.

But former senior US officials and western businessmen with experience investing in Russia said Trump and Putins sign-off alone would not be enough to get Nord Stream 2 up and running.

I cant imagine the board of any major US corporations saying, Hey, lets jump back into the Russian market right now, and the Russians know this too  theyve seen these oscillations in American policy, a former senior US official said.

Europe still has sanctions in place, and Germany signing up for the rehabilitation of Nord Stream would cause huge rifts. Anything like that is a ways off.

Ukraine Will Not Surrender to Russia

The Country Is Open to Talks but Will Fight a Forced Deal

Since his return to office in late January, U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine as quickly as he can, irrespective of what that means for Ukrainians. Breaking with the Wests years-long isolation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump spoke on the phone for 90 minutes with the Russian leader without informing Ukraine or European allies beforehand. Then, in mid-February, Trumps Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, held preliminary talks with his Russian counterpart in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, without including representatives from Kyiv. 

Trump has meanwhile labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator and, inexplicably, blamed Ukraine for starting the war that began with Russias seizure of Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014 and vastly expanded in February 2022 with Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ive had very good talks with Putin, and Ive not had such good talks with Ukraine, Trump said on February 21. The message is clear. Washington is moving to end the war on its and Russias terms, no matter what Ukrainians think.

Trumps strategy to sideline Ukraine in peace negotiations with Russia not only violates basic international norms of diplomacy but is also strategically mistaken. Washington may have leverage over Kyiv, since ending U.S. military assistance would greatly impede the countrys ability to fight. But the Trump administration cannot simply command Ukraine to lay down its arms. If Trump forces Zelensky into a settlement that is wildly out of step with Ukrainian preferences, it risks falling apart soon after being signed. The views of the Ukrainian people are also critical for the moral and legal legitimacy of any negotiated settlement. After all, it is Ukrainians who are fighting to defend their country and who are dying on the battlefield.

The crucial question, then, is whether Ukrainians are prepared to make concessions to end the war. In the first year after Russias full-scale invasion, the answer was clearly no. In July 2022, we conducted a survey of 1,160 Ukrainians to test whether they would make concessions to Russia if it would save Ukrainian lives and reduce the risk of a nuclear attack. We found, across the board, that they would not. When asked whether they would choose to compromise Ukraines autonomy from Russia or cede territory to Russia to reduce the costs of the war, they overwhelmingly dismissed those options, preferring resistance at any cost.

In December 2024 and January 2025, we repeated our earlier survey. The new results, which we have presented in full in a working paper, show that allowing Russia to control Ukraines government remains a redline that Ukrainians refuse to cross. Yet Ukrainians have become slightly more willing to entertain other concessions. Some, for instance, appear open to leaving Crimea in Russian hands in exchange for minimizing civilian and military casualties. Others would consider forswearing NATO membership. Some are even willing to cede parts of the Donbas. These findings suggest that Ukrainians might be more prepared to accept concessions to limit the costs of the war than they were in July 2022.

Still, Trumps current rapprochement with Moscow is unlikely to produce an agreement that is tolerable to Ukrainians. The U.S. President has embraced Russian narratives about the war and prematurely endorsed Russian demands before any negotiations have taken place, suggesting that a U.S. deal would be lopsided toward the Kremlin; he has, for example, already ruled out a return to Ukraines pre-2014 borders and Ukrainian membership in NATO. The United States also sided with Russia twice at the United Nations on February 24, the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine: first by opposing a resolution that condemns Russias aggression against Ukraine and then by drafting and voting for a UN Security Council resolution that calls for an end to the war without acknowledging the Russian aggression.

As our new survey shows, Ukrainians are not so fatigued by war that they will simply fall in line with imperious great-power demands. They still prefer to resist Russian control over their country at any cost and most still oppose territorial concessions. If forced into a deal that does not forestall an outcome in which Ukrainians may be Russian someday, as Trump stated on February 11, they may find a way to continue fightingperhaps with increased European supporteven if Washington ceases military assistance to Kyiv. Trump would thus fail in his promise to Americans to stop the horrible, very bloody war. Instead, he will make the United States look weak while rewarding Russian aggression and endangering more lives in Ukraine and beyond.

LAND FOR PEACE?

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western commentators have called on the Ukrainian government to cede territory or autonomy to end the war. Russian troops had barely crossed Ukraines border in February 2022 when many U.S. and European strategists and scholars, along with world leaders, declared that the country did not stand a chance against its much larger eastern neighbor. After Ukraine surprised the world and successfully defeated Russias attempt to take Kyiv, many then pressed it to pursue a settlement during talks in Istanbul that March. Although the chorus calling for a peace deal diminished when Ukrainians successfully fought back, it never died down entirely. Since the summer of 2023, the push for a settlement has again grown as Ukraines efforts to regain more territory have stalled. To some observers, the wars relentless cost in lives, its continued damage to the Ukrainian and the global economy, and the risk it poses of provoking nuclear escalation by Russia are reasons to end it as soon as possible.

These calls for a settlement may have a point, on ethical grounds. Just war theory demands that a defensive war must have a reasonable chance of succeeding. Even when a war is based on a just cause, such as self-defense, the war may become morally impermissible if the expected costs significantly exceed the achievable benefitsfor instance, if resistance cannot ultimately stop the aggressor. But whether at this point Ukraines self-defense has a reasonable chance of success remains uncertain. There is also no clear answer to what would constitute excessive costs when weighing the ongoing loss of Ukrainian lives against the goal of preserving autonomy from Russian control. Since it is Ukrainians who primarily bear these costs, their preferences must be paramount. Our new survey shows that they will refuse to settle if the deal in question opens the door to Russian control of their country.

In both our 2022 and 202425 surveys, we did not ask Ukrainians whether they supported talks in general because such a question is vague and loaded. Instead, we put them in their governments position by asking them to consider specific tradeoffs. Respondents were shown pairs of various strategies to pursue over the next three months. Each would entail a course of the war with different territorial, political, and nuclear consequences, as well as additional civilian and military casualties. Some strategies involved continuing to fight to regain all of Ukraines territory, including Crimea and Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, some called for fighting to regain everything except Crimea, and others implied the forfeiture of both Crimea and Donetsk and Luhansk. In some scenarios, Ukraine would retain full political autonomy, in others it would become a neutral state between NATO and Russia, or even become controlled by Russia in its domestic and international affairs.

Some strategies produced, over the next three months, half as many civilian and military deaths as occurred during the first three months after Russias 2022 invasion (6,000), others led to the same number (12,000), and still others produced twice as many (24,000). Some strategies reduced the risk of a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine to zero, others put it at five percent, and others at ten percent. Respondents then had to choose between the strategies they were shown. Critically, the survey only offered options that had a base level of plausibility. The respondents thus had to make tough decisions by weighing the costs and benefits of continuing the war against Russia, just as their government would.

In the July 2022 survey, the findings were unambiguous. Respondents almost uniformly preferred courses of action that preserved Ukraines political autonomy and allowed it to restore its 1991 borders, even if concessions on either of these would have considerably reduced civilian deaths, military fatalities, and nuclear risks. Ukrainians, in other words, rejected compromise. As Zelensky said in March 2022, We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost.

Now, after three full years of brutal combat, Ukrainians appear slightly more open to compromise to end the war. Some respondents, for example, are no longer opposed to forgoing Ukrainian membership in NATO and the EU. In 2022, for example, respondents were 48 percent less likely to choose negotiated neutrality over full political autonomy, even if accepting neutrality significantly reduced or ended the cost in human lives and the risk of nuclear escalation by Russia. By contrast, in the new survey, respondents were only 36 percent less likely to choose negotiated neutrality when offered the same contrasts in costs.

Ukrainians seem also slightly more open to forfeiting Crimea and Luhansk/Donetsk to reduce the costs of war. In 2022, when presented with strategies that came with varying costs, respondents on average chose to keep fighting for full territorial integrity 67 percent of the time. Only in 33 percent of the cases were they willing to cede Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhanskmostly to avoid making political concessions to Russia, but sometimes to reduce fatalities and the risk of a nuclear attack by Russia. Now, they express a preference for fighting for full territorial integrity in 63 percent of the cases; in 37 percent of the cases, they opt to give up Crimea and Donetsk/Luhansk. Importantly, many respondents choose to make territorial concessions to avoid compromising Ukraines political autonomy. Once the issue of political autonomy is taken off the table and the only benefit to ceding the territories is reducing the costs of the war, Ukrainians are more likely to want to keep fighting: 70 percent in this scenario say they prefer preserving full territorial integrity, whereas just 30 percent choose to limit the costs of war.

Ukrainians still prefer to resist Russian control over their country at any cost.

The biggest changes in Ukrainian attitudes concern Crimea. In 2022, Ukrainians expressed a strong willingness to fight for the peninsula, irrespective of the costs. Strategies that preserved Ukraines full territorial integrity at varying costs were selected 66 percent of the time, whereas those that led the Ukrainian government to cede Crimea in exchange for lower costs or the preservation of political autonomy were chosen in just 34 percent of the cases. Now, Ukrainians opt for strategies that preserve full territorial integrity in 59 percent of the time and are willing to give up Crimea 41 percent of the time, in order to reduce the costs of war or prevent Russia from taking political control of Ukraine. While this suggests greater openness to territorial concessions, the effect of having to give up Crimea is still more than twice as large as that of increasing the risk of a nuclear attack. When given a choice between strategies that have no risk of nuclear strikes and those that have a ten percent chance, they choose the no-risk option only slightly more than half (54 percent) of the time, choosing high-risk options nearly as often.

Overall, most Ukrainians surveyed in our 202425 study were still remarkably prepared to bear high costs for continuing to defend their state. When presented with strategies that would quadruple the number of Ukrainian military fatalities over the next three months, from 6,000 to 24,000, for example, respondents selected those costly options 43 percent of the timesuggesting that the rise in fatalities had relatively little effect on their choices, in contrast to having to make political or territorial concessions.

 Most important, Ukrainians remain categorically opposed to any strategy that ends with Russian control over their government. When participants were given a choice between an outcome that led to Russian dominance and one that resulted in full political autonomy, 77 percent chose full autonomy, even if it came at very high cost. This has changed little since 2022, when 81 percent of them did. In the instances when respondents accepted Russian control, they generally did so to pick a strategy that restored Ukraines full territorial integrity with its pre-2014 borders. High civilian casualties, military casualties, and nuclear risks had little effect on their choices.

AMERICAS MISCALCULATION

The reasons to care about how Ukrainians think about the conflict should be self-evident. Ukraines people should, at an absolute minimum, get a say in their own future. Allowing an aggressor to walk away with the spoils of war also violates international law. Any deal that forces Ukraine to transfer sovereign Ukrainian territory to Russia as a result of Russian or U.S. coercion (or both) would lack the force of law. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, of which the United States is a signatory, considers any treaties that violate the prohibition on aggression to be null and void. Moreover, all states have a duty not to recognize territorial claims based on the illegal use of force. Even if Ukraine consented to such a deal, it is far from obvious that this would satisfy international law. Nonetheless, states might be more willing to ignore the legal problems with such a settlementwhether doing so is a good idea or notif it reflects the preferences of the Ukrainian people.

Judging from his statements and his proposed actions, Trump appears to care little about international law or ethics. But his administration should understand that ignoring Ukrainians wishes could have major strategic costs to the United States. Ukrainians are open enough to concessions that Trump might be able to forge some kind of agreement, or at least make progress toward one, by including the countrys leadership in the negotiations and engaging with its concerns. But so far, Trump has treated Zelensky as a secondary player, at best. In doing so, he has set his peace effort on a failing course. Without Zelenskys input, a deal is more likely to cross Ukrainian redlines, with the result that Ukraine and its people will reject it and opt to fight on no matter what Washington says.

If Trump forces Zelensky to agree to his and Russias terms, Ukrainians will likely withdraw the considerable trust they still have in their presidentaccording to a February survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 63 percent of Ukrainians approve of Zelensky. The country will eventually go to the polls and might then select a new leader prepared to openly resist the forced deal. Although Ukrainian elections are one of Putin and Trumps central demands, they might be Ukrainians best insurance against their leader bowing to an imposed settlement.

Indeed, even if Moscow were to control Kyiv, a possibility that Ukraine has already demonstrated would be extremely difficult, it might not put a stop to the war. In a follow-up experiment in our 202425 survey, we drastically increased the number of projected military fatalities up to 160,000 and the risk of Russian nuclear escalation up to 45 percent. Yet even then, Ukrainians opposition to Russian control and major political or territorial concessions was no weaker than it was in the options described above. The strength and durability of their preference to keep fighting suggests that a forced peace on Russian terms might well incite popular resistance in Ukraine and a long, grinding insurgency against foreign rule by Russiaas the experience of other conquered or occupied peoples such as the Irish resistance to British rule, Algerian resistance to French rule, or Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule, makes clear.

Such continued resistance would certainly frustrate Trump, who claimed during the presidential campaign that he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. It might also frustrate Western analysts who have argued that Ukraine will have no choice but to support a deal. Under the banner of realism, for example, the political scientist John Mearsheimer has argued that Ukrainians do not have much choice but to accommodate the Russians to a large extent.

But our new survey shows that Ukrainians themselves are realists. For example, 61 percent think that NATO membership is unlikely to be part of a peace deal. They understand their geopolitical constraints, and they are willing to make difficult decisions. They also understand, better than any outside observers, the costs of giving Russia political influence over their country. When Ukrainians make clear that they categorically and uniformly reject Russian controlthree years into a brutal war that has destroyed many of their towns, killed tens of thousands of their fellow citizens, and uprooted millions morethe West should listen. It means that a deal in which Ukrainians may be Russian someday will not in fact end the war. After all, there is nothing realist about forcing 39 million people into a rump state frantically forged in the furnace of great-power politics.

I have known Volodymyr Zelensky very well for years. As a senior official personally appointed by Zelensky, I spoke to him many times a day and observed him closely both in public and privately. We parted on good terms and without rancour. I have no personal axe to grind. But today I cannot remain silent about how Zelensky is weakening Ukraine under the guise of war. As a result of this new climate of fear I must write these words under the veil of anonymity  a necessary precaution against retaliation from the very regime I once served. 

It pains me to admit that at least some of what Donald Trump has said about Zelensky is true. While western politicians have rushed to condemn Trump and his vice presidents remarks, a quiet ripple of approval ran through large parts of Ukrainian society.

Ukraine has become a paradox: a nation fighting for its sovereignty while dismantling its own democratic foundations. For years, the West has indulged in the illusion of Zelensky as the face of democracy. In reality, he has undermined our democracy, institutions and economy, making Ukraine much weaker in the face of an existential threat  and in the process destroying our nations motivation to fight the Russian aggressor. 

His first presidential term ended in May 2024, but with the war ongoing, no elections were held. Zelensky, who prolongs martial law every three months and has never thought about easing it, as European politicians are suggesting, claims that the people dont want elections. The recent Ukrainian survey confirms this, with 65 per cent of Ukrainians not wanting to have elections throughout the war. But over half of Ukrainians wanted to see the end of the conflict as soon as possible, according to Gallup polling last year. That percentage might be higher now. Moreover, I often doubt we can trust current polls from Ukraine. Today, fear rules over a country where elections are indefinitely postponed, human rights are systematically eroded, and fear dictates daily life.

Zelenskys authoritarian instincts were already becoming clear even before Putins invasion. As early as 2019, I listened as he demanded propaganda from his subordinates to flood the media with praise when his policies failed. Today, he has achieved that: a vast army of voices branding him the face of democracy and the very embodiment of Ukraine itself. 

Ukraine, exhausted of every resource, cannot withstand a prolonged war of attrition. Thousands of Ukrainian men have paid bribes  tens of thousands of dollars  to flee the only European country with sealed borders for men of conscription age. Those who remain live in fear, wary of stepping outside lest they be seized off the streets, in cafés, or in shops  dragged into vans and sent to the front lines. Some of the latest draftees are disabled or chronically ill. Many receive little or no training before deployment. Increasingly, their fates are sealed in recruitment offices as officers wait to be bribed. Wives, girlfriends, daughters, and mothers now take on traditionally male jobs, scraping together whatever earnings they can to bribe officials, desperate to secure exemptions for their loved ones and for young men before they reach conscription age. Yet those with the right government connections are free from conscription and enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement.

War has provided Zelensky with unchecked power, enabling his security forces to act with impunity. In at least eight frontline regions, martial law has given rise to police and military excesses. Under the pretext of hunting down collaborators, state forces raid homes, search phones and laptops, and detain civilians arbitrarily. In such areas, people will never reveal their true thoughts to a journalist or a pollster. They will parrot the states approved rhetoric  Zelensky as a hero, Ukraine as unbreakable. And then, in private, they will say what they really think: that they want him gone.

On a more senior level, accusations of alleged Russian ties are routinely used to expropriate businesses. Scandals involving inflated reconstruction costs and bribes for travel permits are rampant, reflecting a broader erosion of trust in the government. Polls reveal a growing disenchantment among Ukrainians, with over 70 per cent now believing that the government is exploiting the war for personal gain. In some regions suffering relentless bombardment some quietly admit they would rather live under Russian rule. This is not treason; it is a consequence of Zelenskys destruction of democracy. With no clear purpose left in the fight, many now seek an alternative  a pro-Russian candidate willing to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin, or even the grim resignation that life under a Russian flag might be preferable to endless war. The shallow patriotism that Zelensky promotes is crumbling. Exhaustion has set in. The question is no longer whether Ukraine can win, but whether it can even survive under his rule.

The war has given Zelensky everything he ever wanted: absolute power, control over billions in foreign aid, and standing ovations from the world. From his very first day in office  which I witnessed first-hand  he was fixated on securing a second term. Publicly, he dismissed any talk of re-election, insisting it was too early. Privately, he never stopped preparing. Zelensky is obsessed with his approval ratings. Even now, he is laying the groundwork for his campaign. Since September 2024, his administration has been funneling extra payments to those who promote his image online  flooding social media with thousands of carefully curated videos showcasing him as the charming actor-turned-wartime leader, clad in his signature khaki T-shirt. But his more decisive strategy has been the systematic elimination of political opponents.

Former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi  the most formidable potential challenger  was abruptly dismissed last year and reassigned to a diplomatic post. Insiders report that criminal cases have already been prepared against Zaluzhnyi, should he dare to enter politics.

Ukrainians are not cowards. But they do not want to die for Zelenskys government, drowning in corruption scandals, day after day

Meanwhile, former President Petro Poroshenko has just been hit with sanctions  his bank accounts frozen, his assets seized, to the point that he reportedly couldnt even pay for coffee at a gas station. For years, he has dreamed of reclaiming power, moving from Ukraines fifth president to its seventh, and he still commands a loyal electorate. Yuriy Boyko, leader of the party branded as pro-Russian was summoned by the Security Service of Ukraine for interrogation over a TikTok video calling for an end to the war. Zelensky is really preparing for elections, but he wants to make sure there is no level playing field so that he can certainly win them.

Today, Zelensky and his circle have consolidated nearly total control over the state. They can manipulate elections, suppress dissent, and imprison whomever they choose. Independent media are officially banned from television and radio airwaves, while opposition and anticorruption activists active online have been threatened with arrest. One man who had exposed corruption involving Presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermaks brother was sent straight to the frontlines, deployed to the most dangerous combat zones, where he died. Another prominent editor whose revelations brought down former Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov for corruption was saved from jail only by the urgent personal intervention of the US Ambassador. Another editor of an independent media outlet that irritates Zelensky was held by conscription officers for 24 hours incommunicado until he found an understanding with them and went to the front. A parliamentarian who wrote that Zelensky must recognise he is losing and end the war was arrested for treason within three days and is now in jail, following a ruling from the district court of Kyiv.

Before the war, Zelenskys approval rating hovered at 23 per cent. When in the wake of Putins invasion the phrase I need ammunition, not a ride  words spoken not by Zelensky but by an anonymous American diplomat  was widely circulated in the media, transforming him into a global icon. His approval ratings soared past 90 per cent. But over time, they began to erode. Private polling, which I have seen, now puts his support below 10 per cent. Public polls, aligned with the Presidents Office, claim it remains at 63 per cent.

Ukrainians are not cowards. But they do not want to die for Zelenskys government, drowning in corruption scandals, day after day. Only ending the war and restoring democracy and the economy can preserve Ukraine. Continued war will lead not to victory but to the collapse of our nation. Power must change hands. And if Donald Trump does not make that happen, then Ukraine has no hope.

# On third anniversary of invasion, Trump says he is talking to Moscow about economic development deal as Washingtons posture in region shifts

The U.S. sided with Russia and China to win the United Nations Security Councils backing for a resolution crafted in Washington that didnt blame Moscow for the Ukraine war and called for a swift end to the conflict, as President Trump said he was in talks with Russia about an economic-development deal.

Trumps comments and the U.S.s vote at the U.N. on Monday illustrated the extent to which the president has changed the U.S.s [posture toward the region](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-relationship-4decfe96?mod=article_inline), coming on the same day as European leaders gathered in Kyiv to mark the third anniversary of the invasion. 

Earlier on Monday, the General Assembly, which represents the 193 U.N. member states, had approved a Ukrainian resolution pinning the blame on Russia for the war, despite U.S. efforts to kill it. The U.S. was joined by North Korea, Russia and Belarus in voting against it. 

Unlike the General Assembly, the 15-member U.N. Security Council has decision-making powers. The U.S. secured 10 votes from the Security Council in favor of its resolution. Five European countries abstained, including the U.K. and France, underscoring the widening gulf between Europe and the U.S. over the Ukraine conflict.

France and Britain both have veto powers on the Security Council but were reluctant to use them against Washington, diplomats said. French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister [Keir Starmer](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/keir-starmer) is set to meet with Trump in Washington later this week.

The Biden administration took pride in leading Western powers [in an alliance](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/at-g-7-biden-and-european-leaders-agree-to-finance-ukraine-using-russian-assets-42c6f540?mod=article_inline)against Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin), marshaling a far-reaching effort to punish Moscow [through economic sanctions](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/u-s-unveils-new-sanctions-against-russias-energy-sector-before-biden-departs-252a0716?mod=article_inline). Then-President [Joe Biden](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/joe-biden) emerged as a leading critic of Putin on the world stage and framed the conflict as one of democracy versus autocracy.

But Trump has positioned himself as a dealmaker willing to negotiate directly with Russias leader [to end the war](https://www.wsj.com/world/trump-wants-to-end-the-war-fast-russia-has-its-own-timetable-1d1c70f1?mod=article_inline), and he suggested on Monday that he is willing to revive economic relations with Russia, potentially unraveling the Biden administrations efforts. He has also stressed that American taxpayers will benefit from his negotiations via access to mineral deposits.

Following the meeting at the White House on Monday with Macron, Trump said that his administration is making a decisive break with Bidens approach and is on the verge of inking an agreement with Ukraine that would provide the U.S. with access to [that countrys natural resources](https://www.wsj.com/world/a-look-at-the-ukrainian-minerals-that-trump-wants-54edb78a?mod=article_inline). Key to the deal, Trump said, is that U.S. taxpayers can recoup some of the billions spent defending the Eastern European nation.  

Macron, standing next to Trump at a news conference in the East Room of the White House, emphasized that any accord to end the war should include an expansive security guarantee for Ukraine and that he envisions peacekeepers on the ground to enforce it. He also suggested that Trump had agreed that the U.S. would play some unspecified role in supporting a peacekeeping mission.

Europeans are ready to engage to provide for these security guaranteesand now theres a clear American message that the U.S., as an ally, is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach, Macron said. Thats a turning point, in my view, and that is one of the great areas of progress that weve made during this trip.

The White House didnt respond to requests for comment about whether Trump has committed to provide U.S. military or logistical support for a security guarantee. 

Washington had spent the last few days trying to press Ukraine to drop its U.N. resolution, saying the key was to focus now on building peace efforts. Kyiv refused, and its version won strong backing from the General Assembly. 

The U.S. ended up abstaining on its own competing resolution after the brief three-paragraph text, which focuses purely on calls to end the conflict, was amended by the Europeans to clearly support Ukraine.

https://preview.redd.it/hpb911gmc7le1.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a8fdd176833271ed77b2a89f66763b93f1b103

The U.S. refused to accept any amendments to its resolution at the Security Council later Monday.

Trump declined to answer a reporters question about why the U.S. didnt endorse the resolution that blamed Russia for the war. I would rather not explain it now, but its sort of self-evident, I would think, he said in the Oval Office on Monday. 

Sen. John Curtis (R., Utah) criticized the U.S. position at the U.N., which put us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends. This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy, Curtis said on X. We all want an end to the war, but it must be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraines sovereignty and security and that deter Putin from pursuing further territorial ambitions.

A host of Western leaders gathered in Kyiv on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russias full-scale invasion. A total of 14 delegations gathered in Ukraines capital, including leaders of the European Union, and presidents and prime ministers of Western countries. Dozens of leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Group of Seven countries also participated in a plenary session by video.

Amid the anniversary commemoration events, Trump wrote on social media that he is in serious discussions with Putin about major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia. 

Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon, said the economic discussions with Russia were in their early stages. They have very valuable things that we could use, and we have things that they could use, he said. But he acknowledged that it might not come to fruition. 

Russia, like Ukraine, has large deposits of rare-earth elements. Trump suggested that a deal with Russia could be similar to one that he was trying to craft with Ukraine in which he wants the U.S. to have access to that countrys natural resources.

Trump said the U.S. is getting very close to striking a minerals deal with Ukraine. He said he hoped to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyat the White House in the coming weeks to sign the deal. The country is rich in deposits that are essential for everything from cellphones to the defense industry.

Zelensky has said the administration [should offer a better deal](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraines-zelensky-wants-better-terms-on-minerals-deal-demanded-by-trump-7d3a092f?mod=article_inline) on mineral rights, saying the current U.S. offer demanded ruinous financial contributions from Ukraine.

A deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraines mineral deposits could provide a new incentive for the Trump administration to help the country. I call it an economic security guarantee, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on Fox News. He added that more investment through U.S. companies in Ukraine means that the U.S. will have more interest in Ukraines future.

Macron, during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, also touched on guarantees, saying they would be needed as part of any peace agreement, an apparent reference to European troops serving as peacekeepers in Ukraine if an agreement halting the war is reached. 

Trump said he had asked Putin about the idea for European troops to serve as peacekeepers, and Putin had agreed.

Macron, who was at the White House for talks with Trump and his advisers on Ukraine, described Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine, a contrast with Trump advisers, who have avoided blaming Moscow for starting the three-year-old war.

An agreement to halt the fighting could be reached within weeks, Trump said. 

Earlier, in a videoconference with G-7 leaders including Trump, Zelensky said that for our people, for life overall its incredibly important that American help and support remain. It was the first public statement Zelensky has made to the U.S. president since tensions erupted between the two leaders over the potential deal to exchange Ukraines minerals for U.S. aid. 

Zelensky said his team was productively working with the United States on the economic agreement that we hope to sign in Washington.

By [Maria Varenikova](https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-varenikova) Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine

Feb. 27, 2025Updated 9:51 a.m. ET

Three years ago, support for members of a Ukrainian political party that advocated closer ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia plunged to near zero after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, flattening whole cities and killing tens of thousands of Ukrainians.

The party, called the Opposition Platform for Life, was banned, some members went to jail on charges of treason, and others fled Ukraine. A few former members banded together in a new faction and still sit in Parliament, but have generally kept quiet since the Russian invasion.

Now some of those pro-Russian politicians are attempting an unlikely comeback, inspired by President Trumps attacks on Ukraines current leadership and Russian demands, echoed by Mr. Trump, that the country hold elections.

The politicians are posting widely viewed videos on social media in which they have promoted themselves as future candidates; criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government; and praised Mr. Trump.

The efforts are unlikely to gain much traction in a country that remains overwhelmingly hostile to Russia and the people who have supported it. But analysts say the videos, which are rife with misinformation, could nonetheless stoke divisions at a time when Ukraines unity and its leaders are under threat from a hostile Mr. Trump.

Oleksandr Dubinsky, a former member of Parliament, has produced videos promoting what he calls a pro-Trump and pro-peace agenda from prison, where is he serving time for treason. His videos place blame Ukraines leaders for the war, saying they are committing genocide against the Ukrainian people, an echo of Russian propaganda.

Since November, when Mr. Trump was elected to a second term, the audience for Mr. Dubinskys jailhouse videos on TikTok has grown from about forty thousand to nearly 1.6 million views.

On Feb. 20, two days after Mr. Trump called Mr. Zelensky a dictator, Mr. Dubinsky announced that he would run for president if an election were held. Ukraine was in danger of falling into a new form of dictatorship, Mr. Dubinsky said, accusing Mr. Zelensky of forcing his most prominent potential challengers to renounce running for election.

A former head of the Opposition Platform for Life, Yuriy Boyko, had no activity on social media until early December, when he started posting videos from a newly opened TikTok account. In the videos, he blames Ukrainian radicals for laws sidelining Russian language in public spaces, a theme that has long been voiced by Mr. Putin.

https://preview.redd.it/d20zklfk2qle1.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46fb3906670d6915641849b37c23b5cfb356293e

The pro-Russian politicians appear to have at least some support within the Trump administration. In 2023, Tulsi Gabbard, who is now serving as the national intelligence director, criticized the banning of Opposition Platform for Life, saying that Mr. Zelensky had outlawed opposition political parties.

However, other opposition parties have been operating freely in Ukraine.

The term pro-Russian in Ukrainian politics is generally applied to figures linked to the countrys former Russian-aligned president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled to Moscow after a street uprising in 2014. Former members of Opposition Platform for Life who were once affiliated with Mr. Yanukovych still hold about two dozen seats in Parliament.

Political analysts say the pro-Russia politicians had seen an opening provided by the demands for an election by Moscow to destabilize Ukraine from within.

The role of pro-Russian politicians is to introduce divisive topics into society, said Oleh Saakyan, a political analyst at the National Platform for Resilience and Social Cohesion, an independent think tank. They aim to create divisions between groups like veterans and nonveterans, refugees and those who stayed in Ukraine, and pit them against each other.

Russia appears to be backing a three-stage plan for ending the war that would center on the holding of elections in Ukraine. Under the plan, which emerged after a high-profile meeting in Saudi Arabia this month between U.S. and Russian officials, there first would be a temporary cease-fire, followed by elections in Ukraine, and then signing a peace agreement with a newly elected president.

Ukraine was due to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but the government and civil society groups have agreed that it is impossible to hold an election at a time of war.

Most Ukrainian politicians and analysts say they believe Russia is trying to stir political infighting in Ukraine to distract from the defense of the country, and that Moscow would use the time to regroup and build up forces for renewed combat.

When elections cannot be held according to democratic standards, they become a tool in Russias hands to attack democracy instead of supporting it, Mr. Saakyan said.

Alina Tropynina, the senior editor of [Vox Ukraine](https://voxukraine.org/en/), which monitors social media, said the pro-Russian politicians had been ramping up their posts on social media blaming Mr. Zelensky for the war, apparently in response to Moscows latest plan.

It sounds as though Ukraine started the war and that its end depends solely on Ukraine, leaving out that in fact Russia invaded, Ms. Tropynina said.

Artem Dmytruk, a pro-Russian politician in exile in London, has been accusing the Ukrainian authorities of deliberately prolonging the war, asserting that they benefit from the conflict financially and are hindering peace talks.

Mr. Dubinsky, who describes himself as Trumpist on his social media accounts, posts multiple updates daily praising Mr. Trump and questioning Mr. Zelenskys legitimacy.

On Jan. 6, Mr. Boyko posted a video on TikTok of himself playing a famous Ukrainian Christmas tune, Carol of the Bells, on a piano while wishing his viewers peace.

The timing was significant  it was posted on the same day that the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates Christmas Eve, though the Ukrainian church switched in 2023 to celebrating Christmas on Dec. 25 along with most of Western Europe.

Other Ukrainian politicians who are not aligned with Russia also regularly criticize the government and say they would like to take power themselves.

Dmytro Razumkov, a politician who broke with Mr. Zelensky in 2021 and now leads an opposition faction in Parliament, said he would run for president if elections were held.

I have always participated and always will participate in elections, in one form or another, he said.

But those opposition politicians also say the time is not right for new elections.

I definitely think that elections are already needed, but not during a hot war, said Andriy Osadchuk, a member of Parliament with the opposition Holos party.

Have always loved this subreddit, it's been the only subreddit that I am aware of that actually allowed both sides to express themselves during this conflict.

\-----

Though a lot of other things happened, the Kursk offensive, Ukraine standing its ground elsewhere, they have also been losing ground in the least if I have understood correctly (correct me if I'm wrong).

What has shifted dramatically, is politics:

\-Donald Trump reelected who pledges to end the war and come to some agreement with Russia.

NATO membership for Ukraine has been categorically ruled out now by the US administration. Nothing is clear yet on what other details this may bring, though most people think Russia will keep the annexed territories and some guarantees will be put in place to not allow Russia to attack again, possibly also having European countries post peacekeepers (the Russians have denied they have agreed to this principle).

\-rise of the right in Europe continues: though not in power yet, elections in France, Austria, Germany, (should I even mention Romania?) point to the further shift to the right and undermining of the current establishment. Ukraine is not a main consideration for these parties, but it just shows how the status quo (the status quo that Zelensky is allied to) is shifting.

THEN, there were the events in the oval office yesterday. Best I just say that people should watch the footage themselves and make up their mind. What is clear however is that US-Ukraine relations do not look promising right now, a mineral deal which may have given the US an active interest in Ukraine was not signed, and Zelensky was essentially kicked out of the White House. I even heard that Trump was considering stopping some weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

So my questions to subreddit members are:

What happens now? Will the US and Ukraine mend relations? Or is this the breaking point where the US just stops supporting Ukraine? And if so:

Europe has been vocal about continuing to support them. Can they make a difference and fill the gap in US aid?

And what is the likely scenario of how the war ends now?

"2025-03-02",1740891328,"UA POV: UK signs an agreement with Ukarine to provide $2.8 billion dollar loan backed by Frozen Russian assets -Kyiv Independent","The United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets.

The loan, which is part of the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative, was signed amid President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to London to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

&gt;""The United Kingdom continues to stand in defense of Ukraine. Today's agreement, which contributes to strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, confirms this,"" Ukraine's Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement.

The loan will go towards ""purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine's needs,"" the Finance Ministry said.

In October 2024, G7 countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan.

The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. 

The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.8 billion in loan funding.
Under the G7 ERA initiative, Ukraine had previously received $1 billion from the U.S. and $3.1 billion from the EU.

While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries.

In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors.

The loan's announcement and Zelensky's visit to London comes amid the fallout of a heated exchange in the White House on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Earlier in the day, Starmer, in line with European allies, reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine and Zelensky.

&gt;""We stand with Ukraine for as long as it may take,"" Starmer told reporters at a press briefing alongside Zelensky, adding that Ukraine has ""full backing across the United Kingdom.""

"2025-02-27",1740689188,"UA POV: In the military unit of Nizhyn, a Poltava resident was beaten to death: according to relatives, the deceased had a mental illness and was unfit for service","The mother and sister of the deceased 54-year-old Poltava resident Oleh Kravchenko reported that the man had a mental illness and was unfit for service. But in July 2024, he was mobilized and sent to the Chernihiv region, where he was constantly abused. The last time the man was beaten off - his spleen was beaten off and his teeth were knocked out, he died of his injuries in the hospital

Poltava resident Olha Medianyk contacted the editorial office of Poltava Region, who said that her 54-year-old brother, serviceman Oleh Kravchenko, was severely beaten while serving in a military unit and her husband died from his injuries. The woman also noted that he should not have been mobilized at all because he had a mental illness. Olha Medianyk also published a post about this on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid034jkeE4DZCLHvpKymxKEnCmuRVByoikMs4xX45zyiRCRk3Q47D8geveguvD7racYal&amp;id=100011306530309).

Olga Medianik [explained](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z1109-08#Text) that her brother has had a mental illness for a long time. People with such a disease, according to the table of the schedule of diseases of Order No. 402 of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, should be recognized as unfit for military service, with subsequent exclusion from military registration.

The mother of the serviceman said that her son was diagnosed with manic psychosis and should not have served at all. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Oleg Kravchenko voluntarily went to the CCC, but then he was refused and explained by his diagnosis. And already in July 2024, when the 54-year-old man went to update the data, he was declared fit and a mobilization order was issued. The woman said that in fact, her son had not been given a normal medical examination.

According to relatives, Oleg Kravchenko served in the Chernihiv region after his studies. The incident with the beating occurred in the military unit No. 4\*\*\* of the city of Nizhyn. However, Oleh Kravchenko's sister noted that he was constantly bullied in various ways.

As Oleh Kravchenko's mother noted, about a week and a half ago, her son called her and said that he had been beaten and his spleen had been beaten. Relatives also noted that his teeth were knocked out and he was in the unit for some time, and when the man got worse, he was sent to the hospital. But they could not provide urgent medical care to the victim there and called his mother to take him to Poltava. When the man was brought home, he had almost no pressure. The mother immediately called the doctors, but the next day the man died in the hospital without coming out of the coma.

Roman Istomin, spokesman for the Poltava Regional CCC and SP, explained that a citizen with such a surname, first name, patronymic was called up for mobilization on July 26, 2024. Istomin also noted that during this time, the man could have passed the military medical examination again if he was unfit for military service or illegally mobilized.

It should be noted that Olha Medianyk herself was abroad and could not help her brother in appealing the decision on his suitability, the man's mother also could not do this due to her advanced age.

The mother of the deceased reported that law enforcement officers opened proceedings under Art. 121 Part 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine  infliction of grievous bodily harm, which led to the death of the victim. Vasyl Zub, spokesman for the Poltava District Administration, confirmed that the proceedings had been opened. He noted that the police received information from doctors, and now the Podilskyi unit of the investigative department has registered criminal proceedings  a pre-trial investigation is underway.

&gt;A forgotten section in the channel.

&gt;""What's going on in the Laotian aviation?""

&gt;Well, perhaps nothing new, they fly, shoot, bomb, launch, win. The average flight time per month for the crew today is slightly more than before in a year.

&gt;But there is a nuance.

&gt;The entire section today will be dedicated to this nuance.  


&gt;**The age of the divine UMPK turned out to be short-lived.**  


&gt;Actually, I wrote a long time ago about the need to prepare for the fact that the hohol will find a counteraction to the UMPK and that we need to work preemptively. Many years before the SVO.

&gt;Definitely, the UMPK played a huge role, and literally saved the VKS from huge losses, but nothing lasts forever under the moon and people are creatures who really want to live and do everything possible for their survival.

&gt;The indifferent of all stripes and ranks have long sounded the alarm, but according to the ancient traditions of Laos, no one gives a shit about these worries.

&gt;Bombs fly properly, planned targets are ""hit"", everyone is busy, the columns on the slides are becoming more and more beautiful, the numbers of sorties and destroyed targets in the reports are increasing to such a size that the speakers begin to read them with bated breath and shed a stingy tear.

&gt;But there is a nuance.  


&gt;**They do not hit.**  


&gt;All satellite correction systems have officially left the chat. And our rabmen and of course the Ukrainians have learned how to make portable and mobile electronic warfare stations, which they have stuck all over the LBS on both sides and made the correction of all systems of all ammunition (not only UMPK) based on satellite navigation useless. Just like drones controlled by radio are slowly coming out into the garden.

&gt;Yes, a single UMPK will of course hit area targets like factories, plants, cities. But there are no such targets on the LBS.

&gt;Yes, it would be possible to change tactics and use not one bomb with UMPK on one target, but, for example, 8. Or 16. And then, taking into account the summation of errors, look, the target would be destroyed by one bomb from this pile. In the old days, it was called bombing in a ""salvo"" and was the main bombing mode for all bombers.

&gt;But as you understand, you will have to report that out of 16 targets, only one was killed. Probably.

&gt;And who needs this?

&gt;Well, you get the idea.

&gt;The situation with electronic warfare in the enemy's rear is not much better, but there are zones where the munition can be corrected on the flight route, that's one, and secondly, at altitudes less than 50 meters, there is a signal in places. Therefore, with long-range munitions based on satellite correction, things are better, but not much. Because on all ""fat"" targets, electronic warfare is mandatory. And here the accuracy already depends on what the deviation of the munition without correction per kilometer is.

&gt;What needs to be done?

&gt;Well, we definitely need to stop flying for the sake of flying and dropping for the sake of dropping.

&gt;Switch to working on a smaller number of targets, but with a larger number of UMPKs.

&gt;Accept as an axiom that a single UMPK can only hit its target today by accident, or at a training ground.

&gt;Secure this in commanders' reports.

&gt;Saw and develop ammunition with a laser homing head with illumination from a UAV.

&gt;Finish up television guidance systems and data transmission systems.

&gt;And of course, saw up INSs.

&gt;One way or another, the future belongs to autonomous INSs.

&gt;End of report!

&gt;Oh, and I'll emphasize once again. This is all in Laos. We're doing great. The enemy has no electronic warfare. If a UMPK or a missile misses its target, it's only the pilots' fault. With us, every bomb - missile hits its target. Ask any boss from a general and up. They won't let you steal.","UkraineRussiaReport",99,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iy6t87/ru_pov_fighterbomber_talks_about_reasons_for/"

Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities and villages daily, destroying residential buildings, critical infrastructure, cultural heritage sites, and sports venues, among other facilities.

The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine's nominal GDP for 2024, according to the report.

Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) by the World Bank estimated.

Housing, transportation, energy, trade and industry, and education sectors have suffered the most from Russian attacks, the report read.

Some 13% of Ukraine's total housing stock was damaged or destroyed, affecting over 2.5 million homes.
In the energy sector, the number of damaged or destroyed assets, including production, transmission, distribution, and district heating infrastructure, increased by 70%.

Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts sustained nearly 72% of the total damage.

Published 10 MINUTES AGO

At Lancaster House, a 19th century mansion adjacent to Buckingham Palace, it felt like a moment of truth for Europe, as the continents biggest powers gathered to try to rescue something from a crumbling postwar order.

Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, working in tandem, had a clear message in London: Europe has to prove to Donald Trump that it is part of the solution to the [crisis on its own continent](https://archive.is/o/6RZ82/https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine), not part of the problem.

As one of the UK prime ministers allies put it before the meeting, there was no alternative to patching things up with the White House: The PM will bring people together and politely make sure they realise that there is only one negotiation in town  and thats President Trumps.

Sifting through the diplomatic debris of Trumps [disastrous Oval Office confrontation](https://archive.is/o/6RZ82/https://www.ft.com/content/2108807d-2f06-4cc4-9c83-c6485c941939) with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Starmer and Macron made it clear on Sunday that Europe had to intervene to try to salvage any notion of peace from the war in Ukraine.

Starmer said that meant Britain and France would hammer out with Zelenskyy what a post-truce settlement might look like in Ukraine and then take the European plan to Trump, acting as mediators in the toxic relationship between Kyiv and Washington.

https://preview.redd.it/ggpzounr9cme1.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8380426e4a2b09775341b4b9a38cc1896f89566f

The British prime minister insisted on Sunday that any final deal would have to involve Ukraine  including any agreement on where the post-hostility truce line would be drawn with Russia  but in the meantime, Europe would be spearheading the diplomacy on Kyivs behalf.

That delicate  perhaps impossible task  will now fall to three European leaders with whom Trump appears to have the best relations: Starmer and Macron, who visited the White House last week  and Italys Giorgia Meloni.

It is very, very important that we avoid the risk that the west divides, Meloni told Starmer in bilateral talks in Downing Street before the Lancaster House summit.

The prospect of a permanent rupture between Europe and the US is already causing glee in the Kremlin. Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putins spokesman, hailed Trumps administration for dramatically changing all its foreign policy configurations and swinging towards Moscows view of its invasion of Ukraine.

https://preview.redd.it/rq8orhxz9cme1.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efaa91b6a215dda46bfef704221fee3610efffc6

Peskov told state television that Trumps stance largely coincides with our vision. He said it had previously been impossible to imagine that the US and Russia would vote together on a UN resolution that did not blame Moscow for the conflict.

The real danger of a transatlantic rupture hung over the Lancaster House meeting, bathed in Londons early spring sunshine. As if to highlight the risk, Elon Musk, Trumps bureaucracy-buster, [quoted a post](https://archive.is/o/6RZ82/https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1896026564019830820) from a US political commentator on his X platform on Sunday saying it was time to leave Nato and the UN. The billionaire added: I agree. 

Starmer and Macron have gone out of their way to throw a diplomatic arm around Zelenskyy  literally in the case of the UK prime minister at Downing Street on Saturday. King Charles also met the Ukrainian leader on Sunday.

But behind the hugs was a hard warning to the Ukrainian leader that the path to any durable peace runs though the White House and that Zelenskyy must start talking to Trump again and sign a deal to hand over [some future mineral rights](https://archive.is/o/6RZ82/https://www.ft.com/content/1890d104-1395-4393-a71d-d299aed448e6) in his country to the US.

Starmer was at pains, according to British officials, to make it clear to Trump in a phone call on Saturday night that the Lancaster House summit was not a case of Europe trying to gang up against him.

https://preview.redd.it/6oj53shqacme1.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67aaf5f99261e7101526407c92e0001ef407c972

The prime ministers priority is to do whatever it takes to defend Ukraine, said one Starmer ally. That means the US has to be involved. You have to fix that relationship and get back to that minerals deal.

But Starmer, Macron and Meloni are also agreed, according to European diplomats, that they will have to lead the diplomatic efforts to preserve the US security guarantee, not just over Ukraine but over the whole continent.

Starmer and Macron have promised a UK-French led force to provide reassurance in the event of a truce in the Ukraine conflict and are urging other European countries to join a coalition of the willing. So far there has hardly been a stampede to help.

But they made it clear, according to British officials, that such a force would be doomed to fail unless the US provides a backstop  or more precisely air cover and surveillance to protect European troops on the ground. 

Starmer also noted the dangers of flawed agreements with Putin, citing the failure of the Minsk accords on Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. We cannot accept a weak deal like Minsk that Russia can breach with ease, he said.

But Trump has given no indication he is prepared to offer assistance to ensure any agreement holds. European promises to re-arm  the president has been telling the continent to stop freeriding on US guarantees for the best part of a decade  may have come too late.

https://preview.redd.it/k9th5br0bcme1.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac8736e242df3c15ea2359f1e0108ca418d279f

Trump told Starmer this week that he considered the future presence of American companies and workers in Ukraine  exploiting the countrys mineral reserves  to be enough of a deterrent to Putin.

Perhaps for want of other options, Europe is attempting to control the damage. Macron told La Tribune Dimanche newspaper on Sunday that he was trying to make the Americans understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interest.

We should not spare our effort to maintain a strong transatlantic bond, Lithuania president Gitanas Nausda wrote on X after a video call with Starmer and other Baltic leaders on Sunday morning.

There is also deep concern in some European capitals, especially those along the EUs eastern flank that are most exposed to the Russian threat and especially dependent on American protection, that a rift with Trump over Ukraine could further undermine the US commitment to collective defence in Nato.

Meloni  a staunch supporter of Kyiv who also has good relations with Trump  has been pitching ideas to limit the fallout from the Oval Office row, with her public call for an immediate US-EU summit to jointly discuss Ukraines future, and a telephone conversation with Trump on Saturday night. 

But Germany, Spain and Poland are among those countries that have not committed to sending troops to Ukraine, while the EU is only now drawing up a plan to try to boost the continents spending on defence.

There is growing frustration in London that some of Europes leaders need to stop publicly criticising Trump and his diplomatic assault on Zelenskyy and start showing the White House they have the will to take responsibility for their own backyard.

What Ukraine needs now is guns and butter, said one Starmer ally. It doesnt need people tweeting and virtue signalling. At Lancaster House on Sunday there was plenty of talk, but Europe knows it now needs to act.

State Department terminates U.S. support of Ukraine energy grid restoration

The USAID initiative had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in helping Ukraine's energy grid recover from attacks from Russia.

By Vaughn Hillyard

WASHINGTON  The State Department this week terminated a U.S. Agency for International Development initiative that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to help restore Ukraine's energy grid from attacks by the Russian military, according to two USAID officials working on the agencys Ukraine mission.

Power outages have been applied overnight in some regions of Ukraine due to the attacks on energy facilities. The countrys systems have sustained near-constant impact throughout the course of the three-year war.

It significantly undercuts this administrations abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and itd signal to Russia that we dont care about Ukraine or our past investments, one USAID official involved in the Ukraine mission told NBC News. 

The official continued: Russia is fighting a two-pronged war in Ukraine: A military one but also an economic one. Theyre trying to crush the economy, but USAID has played a central role in helping it be resilient, \[including\] shoring up the energy grid&Weve provided vast amount of support to the Ukrainian government to avoid a macro economic crisis.

In addition to ending the Ukraine Energy Security Project, USAID is also dramatically downsizing its presence in Ukraine.

Before the Trump administrations latest moves, 64 American government employees and contractors were serving on the ground in Ukraine for the agency. Just eight of those personnel are slated to remain on the ground in the war-torn country after the Trump administration placed its remaining global workforce on administrative leave and ordered those workers not deemed critical to return to the U.S.

The two officials warned that USAID withdrawing from Ukraine would leave its energy grid vulnerable in the heart of the winter as it endures assaults from further Russian missiles.

A State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Both officials also asserted that USAID plays the foremost role in ensuring financial aid provided to Ukraine is spent for its intended purposes.  

Based on a document obtained by NBC News, the State Department has also ordered the termination of a program focused on financial sector reform activity.  

We wont have the eyes on where this money has gone over the last few years, one of the officials said. 

USAIDs Bureau for Europe and Eurasia, which oversees the Ukraine mission, has 115 staff based in Washington, D.C. The bureaus staff has been told that number would be pared down to 29 employees remaining active, according to the two USAID officials.

As usual, we begin this update on the Kursk front. Starting in the north, after a little over 3 months of heavy clashes, Russia finally broke through in [Pogrebki, with their assault groups clearing out the remainder of the village as well as Orlovka](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1ixyqc8/ru_pov_soldiers_from_the_34th_brigade_and_the_1st/) to the south of it. This advance is the culmination of a few weeks of fighting, where Russian assault groups had to essentially bomb out every single house, basement and [piece of rubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1isj92j/ru_pov_stormtroopers_from_the_34th_mountain/), often using their tried and true tactic of throwing anti-tank mines inside to destroy the position.

Ukrainian troops fought valiantly, but the highly unfavourable reinforcement/resupply route, coupled with constant pressure on logistics elsewhere in Kursk, meant that they just couldnt withstand the attacks any longer. The few surviving troops have pulled all the way back to Malaya Loknya, where Ukraine [is gearing up for a final stand](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1izjiei/ru_pov_vdv_xguides_lancet_loitering_munition/) for the northern side of the Kursk front.

https://preview.redd.it/hzcf0nz3t0me1.png?width=2071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af99c6efb3cff602833c37b0292ce6d1d0b71614

To the south, continuing on from the [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iyfker/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/), the Russian assault groups that entered Lebedevka 2 days prior have continued their attacks, taking over the remainder of the west side of the village, as well as most of the centre of the town. The Ukrainian garrison here is falling apart quickly, as the settlement is just too isolated from the rest of their forces, [meaning supply](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j081m6/ru_pov_fiberoptic_drones_hit_ua_vehicles_and/) and [mechanised support](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1j05t1t/ru_pov_fiberoptic_drone_hit_ua_marder_1a3_kursk/) is incredibly difficult. At the current pace, Russia will take the Lebedevka within a few days.

Even further south, there are reports that Ukraine has abandoned their remaining positions in Kurilovka (50% Russian controlled) after a few weeks of fighting, pulling back to the adjacent forest to the west. Russia is reportedly conducting combing operations now, although until that is done no advance can be confirmed (only greyzone expansion).

https://preview.redd.it/lod0ta5bs0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39b61a96be9ac2527278c1b1042e7c336d0054fa

Picture 2: No advance

Now for the topic that has stirred a lot of interest this week, we move to Toretsk. Over the past 2 days, Ukraine has launched several infiltration attacks into the town, using very small groups of troops in Armoured cars or on foot. These groups are ignoring any semblance of frontlines or clearing operations, and are just trying to push as far into Toretsk as possible and dig into whatever position they end up in.

With this particular day, one such group was confirmed to have moved into Toretsk from the north, reaching the stadium area before their vehicle was destroyed. Suriyak left this area as greyzone for this update as from the video it was unclear what happened to the soldiers in the vehicle, although this gets updated in a later image.

https://preview.redd.it/qboid5ebs0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34a29ff6f3505ebffb9b5a849f6227196faa84d1

Picture 3: Advance = 2.16km2

Following on from the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iyfker/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/), over the past 4 days the Russian troops that entered Pyatykhatky cleared and captured the village. There is still some Ukrainian infantry in the forest west of here, but due to the now unfavourable position they will likely pull back north of the stream within the next few days.

Referring back to my list from [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1e2ali9/comment/ld036c1/), this means Lobkove is now the last settlement left for Russia to recapture to completely undo all Ukrainian gains during their 2023 counteroffensive. Obviously this is irrelevant, as recapturing that territory was never a direct Russian goal (hence why they havent tried to push in this are until now), but it would be at least a small PR win for them.

Following on from picture 1, starting with the north again, with Ukraine losing its positions in Pogrebki and Orlovka, Russia has been able to advance even further in this area, taking over Novaya Sorochina (mostly abandoned) as well as the treelines and railway line to the northeast. As mentioned in my earlier comment, Ukraine has pulled most of their outer troops back to Malaya Loknya and are preparing their defences for the inevitable assault, meaning Russia has been able to clear most of the area to the north quite quickly. Staraya Sorochina or Nikolaevka are likely the next target, if Russia does not try directly push south along the railway to reach Malaya Loknya.

https://preview.redd.it/4vkgg3g7t0me1.png?width=1617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c167ef17b1eca276d57a4d1881681349a99e49

To the south, Russian assault groups were confirmed to be in control of Nikolskii, following a few weeks on fighting in the area. Russian troops were actually dropped off here back in January, taking up positions in the basements and treelines, and from the reports it looks like those troops were never fully driven out by Ukraine, leading to the eventual capture. Russias hold on Nikolskii is a bit fragile due to the only supply route being via the open fields, however if they can properly secure it and push east, they could cut off Ukraines supply lines to Malaya Loknya (the railway line and road east of it).

https://preview.redd.it/eqtmif38t0me1.png?width=1887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=654beabe8bf27d8a757eff38d25db104d61ce538

Even further south, in Lebedevka, the Russian assault groups made further progress, capturing the last of the north side of the village, as well as more of the south side. At this stage there is only the last few houses along the one street, which are being cleared by Russia now.

https://preview.redd.it/f7yocfgcs0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5619c0ff0aa2bc8dc14e48f74cd58e3bd369b73b

Picture 5: Advance = 4.29km2

Over on the Kupyansk front, Russian troops continued advancing south of Dvorichna, talking over a forest area and some treelines next to the Oskil River. Whilst Russian DRGs are active around Kindrashivka and Holubivka, no assaults of either settlement have taken place yet. Ukraine have also somewhat stabilised the northern Kupyansk front after bringing in more troops and equipment, however they have been unable to launch a successful counterattack so far due to Russian drone strikes disrupting their movements ([video 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iyto7n/ru_pov_fiberoptic_drones_hit_ua_bov3_antiaircraft/), [video 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iytqeb/ru_pov_fiberoptic_drones_hit_ua_bov3_and_damaged/), [video 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1ivl64s/ru_pov_the_fighters_of_the_16th_separate_special/), [video 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1ivpqj8/ru_pov_vt40_daynight_and_kvn_fiberoptics_drone/)). Russia is still relying on infantry on foot, coupled with heavy drone support, to advance in this area, as no vehicles have been spotted here yet.

https://preview.redd.it/xq5si2pcs0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f90581d8a861bd156365e1f957d2d442c4460f07

Picture 6: Left Advance = 0.17km2, Right Advance = 0.10km2, Bottom Advance = 0.62km2

In Chasiv Yar, heavy fighting continues in the town. On the northwest side, Ukraine counterattacked, managing to retake 2 of the streets of the western suburbs. This is likely an attempt to ease the pressure on their garrison in the central area, who are under heavy shelling and frequent attacks. In said central area, Russia captured a row of apartment buildings, and are currently attacking the next row over.

Slightly south of that, a different group of Russian troops has begun to advance into Chasiv Yars southern suburbs, taking over some houses and industrial buildings. Progress remains slow, and both sides are using numerous drones making operations very difficult.

https://preview.redd.it/ck1tx93ds0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a443d5afa7ba5f575d347a9d1422908edf51ba

Picture 7: Advance = 0.06km2

Following on from picture 2, the Ukrainian group that reached the stadium area were confirmed to have holed themselves up in a few of the houses and one of the apartment buildings. They are currently being shelled and hit by drones as Russia prepares to counterattack.

To the south, another Ukrainian group on an armoured car infiltrated the southern side of the town overnight, crossing the fields and reaching the houses on the southwestern corner. Russia spotted this group as they were moving in, and in the morning filmed themselves destroying the buildings the Ukrainian soldiers occupied by throwing in anti-tank mines. Thus Suriyak has left this area as greyzone, as its unclear whether any Ukrainian troops remain or were wiped out by the Russians.

Picture 8: Advance = 1.44km2

Moving to the Kurakhove front, over the past few days Russia secured the southern side of Kostyantynopil, bringing in more troops as they start to push north further into the town. Ukraines garrison are still maintaining their positions, however heavy shelling and constant drone attacks are adding up and with a sketchy at best supply route, they wont be able to hold out for too long. Ukrainian counterattack attempts from Bahatyr have all failed to drive Russia back, with drones knocking out tanks and IFVs before they can even reach Kostyantynopil.

Picture 9: Top Advance = 5.67km2, Bottom Advance = 2.01km2

On the Velyka Novosilka front, Russian assault groups continue to advance, capturing a number of fields south and southeast of Burlatske (blue dot). From Russian reports, they claim that Ukraines garrison have all but abandoned the village before the battle even began, being too few to hold against a Russian assault. Instead they have allegedly moved to the northernmost street in Burlatske and only plan on using drones to harass the Russians before withdrawing. Obviously I cant attest to how true this is, but Ill note that Ukraines manpower issues on this front are well known and Russia has been able to cross the gap between Vremivka and Burlatske very quickly, so things clearly arent going well for Ukraine.

Additionally, southwest of this advance, a separate Russian group captured several fields as they push north towards Pryvilne (small village east of Vilne Pole).

Following on from picture 4, Russian troops were confirmed to have made a minor advance south of Novaya Sorochina, clearing one of the treelines. This group is headed for Staraya Sorochina, although havent tried to assault the village yet.

https://preview.redd.it/1cfzz35at0me1.png?width=2163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a544cbae0c217d500c138d2a7ca98a05ff7110ed

Moving south, Russian assault groups captured the remainder of Lebedevka, confirming full control of the village (as well as the treeline immediately south). This does mean Russia now have an open path right into Sudzha, however as Ive explained before an attack would be almost impossible to pull off. Instead, Russia can begin to move north to Loknya (under the k, a big livestock farm), which would put additional pressure on Ukrainian troops in Malaya Loknya. The capture of Lebedevka also means Russia is now within ATGM range of the northern supply road (expanded on in comment below).

Southwest of here, Russia was confirmed to have secured most of Novenke (a small forest), after crossing the border last week. Whilst other Russian sources show much greater territorial control in this area, including claiming Russian troops are in Basivka, Suriyak is leaving more of this area as greyzone until more evidence is released. From the reports fighting is ongoing in this area, with lots of attacks and counterattacks as both sides try to secure positions in Basivka.

https://preview.redd.it/dknr0e1js0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11349b864b4d7c07827716c5678722311c077734

Picture 11: Top Left Advance = 0.79km2, Top Right Advance = 0.74km2, Upper Left Advance = 0.15km2, Upper Right Advance = 0.13km2

Following on from picture 7, Ukraine flooded even more infiltration groups into Toretsk, moving back into the northern suburbs, western forest, and western suburbs. At the same time, Russias counterattack and bombing of the Ukrainian group near the stadium paid off, as they have now recaptured that area.

To explain what has happened, Russia never completely captured Toretsk, as there were still the slag heaps on the northern side of the town and the outermost buildings to secure. Despite not manning those areas and not expanding the buffer around Toretsk, Russian units were already moving to a rest and reorganise phase, which they typically do after larger settlement battles. This meant that the perimeter of Toretsk was not being defended properly, leaving openings for Ukraine to sneak back into the town. This has led to Ukrainian command flooding small infiltration groups (reportedly 5 or fewer people each), who are just rushing deeper into Toretsk and occupying random buildings. The goal of these groups is to cause as much chaos and confusion as possible, stalling so that Ukraine can bring in more troops to resecure part of Toretsk. The situation is incredibly fluid right now, as these small groups, whilst catching the Russians off-guard, are also very vulnerable with no clear supply lines (right now). Russia has brought its troops back to the front and begun to counterattack, but its not certain they will be able to push Ukraine back before the retake a large portion of Toretsk. This is absolutely a serious failure by the Russian command in this area, and one that could prolong the battle for weeks, if not months.

This also means that Suriyak has the last laugh here, as despite the criticisms and most other mappers stating the battle for Toretsk is over, he refused to mark it as such and insisted that until Russia secured the outermost buildings and slag heaps then Ukraine could always push back in (stated on 19 February).

Picture 12: Advance = 1.97km2

On the West side of the Pokrovsk front, Russian forces made a new advance southwest of Nadiivka, taking over another chunk of the tree plantation. This puts them in a better position to assault the village of Preobrazhenka, now having 2 treelines that run all the way down from their current positions into the settlement.

https://preview.redd.it/tk6h0d1ks0me1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eff0002e4eb9c90eb5dc14c3c47c6d3e1517607

Picture 13: Middle Left Advance = 10.22km2, Bottom Left Advance = 0.39km2

Following on from picture 9, Russian forces made significant advances across a wide area of the front, capturing the entirety of Pryvilne, most of Burlatske, and a large area of fields around these villages. Burlatske will likely fall within the next day or so, as only that northern street I mentioned earlier remains. The capture of Pryvilne also means Russia is right next to the village of Vilne Pole, so they will likely attempt an assault within the next 2 or 3 days. Even though we were only just talking about the loss of the first defence line [3 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iyfker/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/), Russia is already closing in on Ukraines second defence line in this area, now just 2km away (dark blue line).

There was also a small Russian advance to the west of Novosilka, with a few Russian troops expanding the buffer around the village by taking over a treeline. Its unclear whether Russia intends to make an attempt on Zelene Pole (blue dot bottom left), or will just continue their attacks north.

Additional Comments:

·         Ukraines control of Kursk currently sits at 390.50km2. Ukraines maximum control in Kursk was approximately 930km2, short of their initial claim of 1000km2, and well below their revised claim of 1300km2.

Picture 1: Top Left Advance = 1.99km2, Bottom Right Advance =1.56km2

Starting off once again in Kursk, in the exact same areas as the [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iw2ap4/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/). On the west side, as I briefly mentioned last time, Russian assault groups started to advance out of Sverdlikovo, and were able to establish a foothold in western Lebedevka, taking over the houses on both the north and south side of the Loknya River. Fighting is currently ongoing in the centre of the village, as Russia continues the attack. Like with battle for Sverdlikovo, Lebedevka has the same issues for Ukraine in that its quite isolated and difficult to reinforce/resupply the garrison, so they will struggle to hold the settlement.

Moving southwest, over in Cherkasskaya Konopelka, as I predicted last update, Ukraine was unable to reinforce the infantry that were occupying the village and over the past few days Russia has driven them out and recaptured the settlement. This means virtually all the land Ukraine took during their offensive attempt [2.5 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1ikpk54/ua_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/), aside from the field area north and northeast of the village which is mostly in the greyzone. Russia will likely clear this area out over the next few days, and reorganise their troops in this area so they can renew attacks on Makhnovka.

Ill also note there havent been any updates on the Russian attacks across the border into Sumy since last post, aside from the [occasional drone strike video](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iy23am/ru_pov_83rd_guards_airborne_assault_brigade/).

Picture 2: Top Advance = 0.26km2, Bottom Advance = 2.39km2

Onto the Siversk front, where for the first time in years weve seen a significant change in the operational space. [2.5 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1ignga4/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/) when Russia started to launch some smaller attacks around Siversk, I mentioned that we might be seeing the front be reactivated for the first time in over a year. **This has now been confirmed.**

There were 2 directions of attack, from within Bilohorivka and from the south. The north one, despite being a relatively small advance, is actually incredibly significant for this front. Russian assault groups launched an attack on the large bunker network next to the chalk quarry (really just a massive network of dugouts and tunnels expanded over the past 2 years), capturing it over a few days of fighting. This bunker network is what has held up the fighting around Bilohorivka for the past few years and what has prevented Russia from being able to secure the (ruins of the) town. Without this defence point Ukraines forces in this area are in a much worse position, and it provides Russia a good staging point for further attacks west.

The southern advance saw Russian assault groups pushing through the forest area southwest of the chalk quarry over a few days, clearing out the many small trenches and dugouts littered throughout. With this area under their control, they can begin to push north towards the road in this area and try flush Ukrainian troops out from the remaining trench networks in this area.

https://preview.redd.it/t5wmk2z1yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=054dcf07133b6a125da7cf891e2b114212276fe0

Picture 3: Middle Advance = 2.87km2, Lower Left Advance = 1.64km2

On the Velyka Novosilka front, Russian forces continued their advance, pushing north over the small stream as they head towards Dniproenerhiya, as well as expanding their control over the Ukrainian defence line (broken a few days back) to the northwest of Velyka Novosilka itself.

https://preview.redd.it/qvraapr2yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9ffd62c7884a5140f1f67fc502c7286c39f6b6

Picture 4: Top Advance = 0.05km2, Bottom Advance = 0.02km2

Moving to Vovchansk, there was another small advance made by Russian in the positional battles over the ruins, with a squad taking up positions in the rubble of some of the residential buildings. As with all the previous mini advances in Vovchansk, it would be more accurate to say these arent advances but more confirmation that Russian troops have been spotted in this area.

There was also a similar minor 'advance' in the centre of the town by Ukraine, being spotted slightly further north than they were before. 

https://preview.redd.it/eo8f2o23yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cce35275288106b3695c423bb605ce2abb2fb58

Picture 5: Advance = 1.45km2

Following on from the [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iw2ap4/ru_pov_russian_and_ukrainian_advances_from_day/), the Russian infantry that crossed the Oskil River into Topoli cleared out the remainder of the settlement, confirming full control. This means Russia now has a direct land connection to the west side of the Oskil River (as opposed to having to cross by pontoons or boats), and once any mines are cleared out they can start bringing in troops and equipment to develop further attacks into Kharkiv Oblast.

https://preview.redd.it/bbrq1va3yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf2e64610d741032fd715bf6559c40b24bfba1d7

Picture 6: Advance = 2.06km2

South of Chasiv Yar, over the span of a few days Russian assault groups managed to level the front line, capturing positions in the forest areas and along the main road. They are currently setting up for an assault on Stupochky, although its difficult to say when it will begin.

On a side note, fighting is ongoing in central Chasiv Yar, we just arent getting any updates as its the intense back and forth over the apartment buildings, reminiscent of the battle for Bakhmut. We do get the occasional video though, [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1itfcxv/ru_pov_stormtroopers_from_331st_regiment_of_the/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/1iw8jqr/ru_pov_firstperson_footage_shows_paratroopers/).

Picture 7: Advance = 0.73km2

On the west side of the Kurakhove front, Russian troops made a small advance in the treelines west of Andriivka, capturing a trench network. This is the last defensive position before the town of Oleksiivka to the west, where Ukraine is currently preparing its defence. Russian forces are still cleaning up in Andriivka and reorganising, so it may be a few days

https://preview.redd.it/24fr2ds3yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21e930f1418f254ed48c05999026690951dac59a

Picture 8: Lower Left Advance = 10.34km2, Bottom Left Advance = 0.58km2

Following on from picture 3, Russia made further advances northwest of Velyka Novosilka, completely capturing the fields east of the spearhead up to the Mokri Yaly River, as well as another small trench network to the west. This advance also means Russia has breached and captured almost the entire defence line in this area in 4 days.

Ukraine has been suffering from a severe lack of manpower here, as theyve received no new reinforcement units despite the losses suffered in the fighting in Velyka Novosilka. The 110^(th) Mechanised Brigade, which was the unit that had a number of its troops encircled inside the town is still on this front in spite of the losses. Without reinforcements Ukraine will not hold the line here and will continue to be pushed back all the way to the Dnipro Oblast Border.

https://preview.redd.it/cq6ffhn4yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=002444813895533eee236fc81ada8d3af18350c8

Picture 9: Advance = 5.39km2

Heading to the Kupyansk front, on the east side, Russia has made another advance for the third time in a week, confirming they have restarted offensive operation on this area of the front. Theyve captured several fields and dugouts north of Stepova Novoselivka, which is now under threat of being cut off if Russia pushes much further west.

To the west, Russian DRGs operating south of Dvorichna have reached Kindrashivka and Holubivka, both villages directly north of Kupyansk. For now no advance has been confirmed as these are only scouts, however given their movement its clear Russia intends to assault these areas next, and is probing for openings.

https://preview.redd.it/fgfkegw4yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16ea0a002f957afc1c45453f7e854ddfcd08e1c0

Picture 10: Top Advance = 0.21km2, Middle Advance = 0.62km2, Bottom Advance = 0.61km2

Following on from picture 2, Russian assault groups continue to advance in and around Bilohorivka, capturing more positions around the chalk quarry and main road, as well as taking over the last ruins in Bilohorivka, confirming full control of (the remains of) the town after several years of back and forth fighting. Back when the initial capture and recapture of Bilohorivka happened, I remember reading a comment stating that Kyiv or Moscow would fall before Bilohorivka does, and I think that encapsulates the battle quite well. Despite its notoriety that battle has ended without much fanfare, as the slow grinding nature of the war finally caught up to this area.

Ill note that despite the map colouring, Russia does not control any positions on top of the chalk quarry itself, only on the edges of it. Neither side has held positions up there since Ukraine was bombed out last year in what I personally think was one of the most brutal campaigns of the war.

https://preview.redd.it/k4ls9675yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fde6010a3117d4e67241cd5fcfdaa2aa09ba84eb

Picture 11: Upper Left Advance = 0.39km2, Bottom Left Advance = 0.44km2

Heading to the west side of the Pokrovsk front, in Uspenivka, Ukraine launched a counterattacked using mechanised forces, recapturing the central road and houses. Despite its small size, the battle for this village has stretched on far longer than anyone anticipated, owing to both sides constantly pouring in reinforcements.

To the south, Russia captured the last few buildings in Zaporizhzhya, confirming full control of the village. Their next target will be nearby Preobrazhenka, a small village of only a dozen houses, which wont last long once under assault.

https://preview.redd.it/k6hsmbg5yele1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=023b2653893e3b6e18cb6d7e4463e01c44014275

Picture 12: Left Advance = 2.89km2, Right Advance = 1.67km2

Following on from picture 8, Russian advanced north of Velyka Novosilka for the third day in a row, capturing several more fields and treelines on either side of Novoocheretuvate. They currently sit right outside of the small village of Skudne (below Dniproenerhiya), which will likely fall within the next day or 2 as its small garrison are already at risk of being cut off. If they have not left already, the garrison will be trapped as the only road out of the village can be occupied and mined by Russia if their forward troops advance just 800m north, using either of the treelines in the area.
